Bizarre ending to the Jets-Pats game. Ninkovich recovers fumble for the win. Teams swarm field before review was official.
Raiders beat the Jags 26-23 in a game we should never speak of again.
Gostkowski answers Folk's boot with a FG of his own to send the Jets and Pats to OT.
Mark Sanchez just gave New England a fighting chance.
Devin McCourty giveth (104-yard TD return in the 1st Q). Devin McCourty taketh away (fumbled KOR with 2 minutes to go in tie game)
Inexcusable drop by Stephen Hill.
One hour until the Cardinals and Giants face off in Game 6 of the NLCS. Will the series end tonight or go the distance?
That's two touchdowns from Brady to Gronkowski today. This one was much easier than the first. NE 23-13.
Good effort by Denarius Moore to reach into the end zone. TD Raiders.
MJD in street clothes and on crutches along the Jaguars sideline. Left foot injury, severity TBD.
The Raiders offense is no way devoid of talent, in fact it's quite the opposite, but when they line up as a unit it's hard to tell.
Submit your fantasy Q to @sinow or @SI_DavidSabino and the http://t.co/Daltua6L expert roundtable could answer on Tuesday #SIroundtable
As of right now Tim Tebow has outrushed Darren McFadden six yards to five.
Jury is still out on severity of MoJo injury but MJD owners should be climbing over themselves to pick up Rashad Jennings.
Heck of a TD catch by Gronkowski diving in the end zone.
@AlbanyHDTV 4 balls thrown to him, one picked off, three incomplete. Can't catch a TD every game.
Vincent Jackson has 216 yards today passing Mark Carrier's Tampa Bay record of 212 receiving yards in a game.
Santana Moss now has 15 career TD catches in the Meadowlands (Giants and MetLife Stadiums), most among all active players.
@thestlcardsfan4 Last year.
@theCEDproject He's not.
Prior to that TD by Steven Jackson, the last Rams RB to run into the end zone was Cadillac Williams.
RT @SI_PeterKing: A lot of plays of the day today, but wait till you see the tackle from behind by Malcolm Jenkins in Saints-Bucs.
Big four down goalline stand by the Saints D stones Bucs drive after huge pass play to Vincent Jackson.
Send your fantasy Qs to @sinow or @SI_DavidSabino and the http://t.co/Daltua6L  expert roundtable may answer in this week's column.
Drew Brees' 313 yards are the 10th most in a first half since the AFL-NFL merger. He also had the most (346 yds.) in '07 vs. the Jags.
No Jimmy Graham, no problem. TD David Thomas for the Saints.
Joe Flacco is 4 of 15 for 32 yards and an interception in the first half.
Santana Moss goes 26-yards into the end zone untouched on a screen from RG3. Was 10-NYG 7
Andrew Luck runs for another TD. The RG3 vs. Luck debate rages on.
Jamie Harper rains a little on the Chris Johnson parade with a vulture TD.
It's very fluid right now but NFL passers are completing over 70% of their throws so far today into the 2nd Qs of every game.
@EricMackFantasy Well played.
Welcome back, Chris Johnson. Where have you been?
@JohnFraser31 @SI_DavidSabino That's what I would've done.
@JohnFraser31 @SI_DavidSabino Roberts is already playing.
Send your fantasy Qs to @sinow or @SI_DavidSabino and the http://t.co/Daltua6L expert roundtable may answer in this week's column.
Adrian Peterson already has 4 rushes for 48 yards and a TD on a sweet run then reach over the goalline. Vikes up 7.
Andrew Luck can run into the end zone too. TD Colts.
TD Chris Johnson. This is going to be a track meet today at the Ralph.
@SInow @jTron9 Correction. Not Cards but yes Titans.
@jTron9 Yup. Both Chiefs and Cardinals QBs are ahead of him.
I keep looking for a Selmon brother on the field with the Bucs wearing the throwback tangerine jerseys today.
First Adrian Peterson and now Terrell Suggs. Medical advances for sports injuries are simply amazing.
What's going to be the highest scoring game today? Titans-Bills? Saints-Bucs? another?
@Semery10 Greene.
@JoelGarcia9 RG3 all year long.
@mgugs46 Nope. Can't trust Cards run game.
Only 41% of Matt Schaub's completions have gone to WRs. Only Philip Rivers (34%) is lower. Surprisingly Mark Sanchez is highest-70.5%)
@sjwalton425 @SI_DavidSabino @SInow Luck
@sjwalton425 @SI_DavidSabino Both good, Hernandez better.
Ben Roethlisberger's passer rating on 3rd down? 121.3 (1st in league)  Tony Romo's? 43.4 (34th)
C.J. Spiller leads NFL backs with 8.1 yards per touch this season. Megatron leads receivers with 15.9.
Ahmad Bradshaw, Trent Richardson, Adrian Peterson, Lance Moore all ACTIVE
DeMarco Murray, Jimmy Graham, Kevin Kolb, Greg Jennings, Pierre Garcon, Jake Locker, Donald Brown all INACTIVE today.
@mike_at_remax Load up on the Cowboys.
@gbuentello On paper it's probably Roethlisberger but I just can't tell you to sit Rodgers especially in a desperate situation.
@colinstoesz Wright
@BrendanMohlerGW Arizona.
@puzzletrax Morris
@SharpHarp92 Can never trust Pats injury reports and i'd be shocked if Gronk didn't play.
@gbuentello Spiller.
@rcoyne324 @EricMackFantasy Freeman has a great matchup but Romo is better this week.
@themlsmith Thomas
@SharpHarp92 No. Stick with Gronk who should have more chances now that Hernandez is back.
@gbuentello Jackson
@SharpHarp92 for who?
@wilkentj Yes with Brown and Bradshaw ahead of Wilson for NYG.
@MJMager Vikes with Skelton at QB and no running game for AZ.
@bhayden21 Gotta sit Bryant and Wallace and look to make a trade ASAP.
@wilkentj With Forte good to go he's limited to short-yardage or mop up duty.
@RY4N_D4RCY Dallas' D will concentrate on Smith and CLE doesn't have the DBs to stop Luck. Take a chance on Avery.
@philipleone @SI_DavidSabino PPR, sure. Neither will remind anyone of LT2.
@B_R_West Both teams will pass a lot. Slightest edge to Ben because of strength of supporting cast.
@badams206 I'd sit SJax.
@_ARII3 Lloyd
@Pat_Noble Nicks.
@wilkentj Such a tough call but I'd go with Brady by a tiny bit.
@gatorzzzz I like RG3 based on his running ability.
Send your #fantasyfootball trade/waivers/strategy Q's to have a chance to get it answered by http://t.co/Daltua6L's experts roundtable.
@mgugs46 I'd keep him in there. Roethlisberger's grumblings plus Bengals secondary should = good game for Brown.
@TYinUTAH @SI_DavidSabino TY Hilton.
@deafjeffm I'd sit Ballard.
@BurgerisaKeeper @SI_DavidSabino Felix.
@damiansmith0812 Cook. Finley has fallen off badly of late.
@EricMason4 RG3 because of his running.
@mgugs46 Blount-Hardesty. Woodhead decent since Pats RBs are thin today and vs old team but I like the others better.
@LynnKupfer Martin/Ridley
@DS_213 Very hard to trust. I'd look elsewhere.
@nastaiger Felix
@parfornick Colston.
@Kastman4 Wright, Morris and Greene.
@paydawg @SI_DavidSabino Denver's off so Tamme's out. Maybe Keller makes an appearance on the stats sheet.
@coachruda I like Martin and Washington.
@philipleone @SI_DavidSabino I don't trust Dwyer. Has done nothing all year. Was healthy scratch last week. If PPR can use Peerman
@qbkilla76 RG3 based on running ability.
@bugler54 @SI_DavidSabino Kickers are a crapshoot but I'd go with Nugent.
@wilkentj Should have easier time this week not having to concentrate solely on pass-blocking
@SportsIsLife_23 He's been great but I'd have to sit Rudy.
@BarelyRegal Ben and Gordon.
@Mgodsey2011 Peerman coming off of great game and BJGE disappointing. It's a gamble but PPR gives Peerman the edge.
@dwmiller1412 Fitz and Cobb
@WillSmiththe2nd Yes. He's running well and the team is phasing out SJax.
@mgugs46 I like both Tanner and Blount this week better than Woodhead.
@AdamWeigle No reason he shouldn't. In light of Big Ben's recent comments I'd look for more deep shots for he and Wallace.
@WestonWilcoxon @SI_DavidSabino Yes. Leading the league in yards per carry.
@McBeth88 I'd sit Bush.
@Chest_Rockwell7 Good luck.
@KGsDADDY11 @SI_DavidSabino Gordon
@Zach_Anderson40 Bradshaw.
@MarkyMark2_0 @SI_DavidSabino I don't trust DHB yet. Ogletree ready to break out again. I like Gordon too but go with DAL
@bugler54 @SI_DavidSabino I'd sit Green
@trainwreck00 Such a tough call. I'd have to side with Romo based on the defenses but always risky.
@BurgerisaKeeper @SI_DavidSabino Felix
@Chest_Rockwell7 I prefer Moore.
@wuratm Williams is on a roll and I'd use him in a favorable matchup.
@philipleone @SI_DavidSabino @EricMackFantasy Batch and Allen.
@jmoralez714 @SI_DavidSabino Sorry. Fred.
@somoge17 Luck at home vs. Cleveland.
@SmeeginLegan Greene and Dalton.
@DS_213 Cobb's a solid play today.
@LeeBremer I'd use Brown who should get some touches when Bradshaw needs a breather.
@BornNbredSooner Gordon.
@sirsharkey Ballard and Dwyer have shown nothing. I'd use Bennett.
@drjem5 @SI_DavidSabino RG3 has answered every challenge so far and his running puts him a hair ahead.
@LynnKupfer I'd sit DeA and use Richardson and Tate.
@a_kowalsky @SI_DavidSabino The two Giants are the safest picks. The Redskins give up a lot of points.
@WestonWilcoxon @SI_DavidSabino CJ too streaky. I'd use Spiller.
@Boomerseven @SI_DavidSabino I'd sit Leshoure vs. the very tough Bears.
@wcf8089 Ridley is a solid play anyhow especially vs. Jets and with Bolden out.
@jmoralez714 @SI_DavidSabino I'd go with Jackson given those choices.
@a_kowalsky @SI_DavidSabino Solid depth there. I'd use Bradshaw.
@WillSmiththe2nd Depends on who's available.
@mgugs46 I like Hernandez and would sit Tate.
@TerrazasManny Yes. Bradshaw will start according to multiple reports.
@wilkentj Dez. Smith slumping pre-bye and Pokes DBs are tough.

Tigers 3, Yankees 0. Tigers lead ALCS 2-0.
Redskins rookie backfield has combined for 918 rushing yards and 11 TDs this season. #nomoreshanahanigans
Tom Brady's 58 attempts were a career-high but fourth most in Pats history. Drew Bledsoe (70, 60) and Steve Grogan (59) had more.
If the Bills can pull out this game in the desert the entire AFC East would be 3-3.
The Seahawks stop Brady, Welker and the Patriots on 4th down and take over with 53 seconds left. Seattle 24, New England 23. #12thman
Seahawks have the Patriots on the ropes with 1:14 remaining. The 12th man in full effect.
RG3 has 139 yards rushing and two TDs today following his 76-yard scamper. His 182 passing yards with a TD/INT seem like an afterthought.
Jay Feely kicks a 61-yard FG to tie the Bills at 16. That's right, a 61-yard FG from Jay Feely. #kickersdialinglongdistance

And with minimum 5 NFL games played it's Victor Cruz who started today with an 82.3 ypg average.
It's today's leading (well, tied) receiver Calvin Johnson with 79.4 yards per game. For those with over 100 games played it's Andre Johnson.
@DavidBassily Correct. If it's 100 games its someone else.
@bgilmer80 Yes if qualifier is over 100 games. Not if it's lower.
@A_Garry Nope
@kobie173 say 50.
Did I mention it's not Jerry Rice?
In his 14th season Randy Moss just became the 4th player with 15,000 receiving yards. He ranks 11th in receiving yards per game. Who's 1st?
Redskins Madieu Williams picks off Ponder, zig-zags his way to the pylon for a 24-yard TD.
Tigers take a 1-0 lead on a fielder's choice grounder by Delmon Young that Robinson Cano failed to turn the double play on.
RG3 joins Alfred Morris as rookies with 5 rushing TDs this season.
@mrurbz NFL Films.
With so much pressure on him all the time Kevin Kolb is starting to look like Fran Tarkenton circa 1963.
In the ALCS  Thru 5 1/2 it's scoreless. Kuroda 1 hit allowed, 8 Ks, Sanchez  3 hits allowed, 5Ks.
TD Alfred Morris, his 5th of the year.
Through 6g Greg Zuerlein has tried six 50+yard FGs, made 4. The most 50+ attempts in a season is 11 (3x) and makes is 8 (Morten Andersen)
Jason Hanson's kick gives the Lions a second win.
Tony Scheffler has come up big late in this one. Two huge catches.
Lions ball at midfield after Stefan Logan fumbles then recovers the punt return.
Lions D-Line not looking overrated on those last two plays.
Lions and Eagles tied at 23 with 3 ticks to go.
Dangerous plays by the Lions.
Hasn't Calvin Johnson been involved in more close and controversial plays the past few years than any other receiver?

Move from SD to TB has been no problem. This is the 1st time Vincent Jackson has 4 receiving TDs through his team's first 5 games.
Asante Samuel's 79-yard Pick-6 was his 47th career INT breaking a tie with Ronde Barber who earlier had a 78-yard pick 6 for his 46th INT
@TerrazasManny No reports of an injury.
After review, the pee wee play resulted in a KC touchdown after all.
Today's is just the second 3-INT game of Matt Ryan's 70-game career (including the playoffs).

Shonn Greene is the 6th Jets rusher with multiple career 100-yard, 2 TD games. Can you name the other 5?
Redskins WR Pierre Garcon is INACTIVE today
Ronde Barber's 45th interception and 8th TD is the most bizarre. Ball popped up to him off of players laying on the ground. Ran 78 yards TD
Mike Williams became the first Bucs receiver with 100-yards in the first half since Antonio Bryant in 2008.
Bad day for DB:. Morris Claiborne and Lardarius Webb are both injured in the Ravens-Cowboys game.
And now the Lions have a pick too, Louis Delmas grams an errant Michael Vick throw.
Shonn Greene is making a statement: 11 carries, 63 yards 1 TD.
TB TD for Mike Williams from Josh Freeman and TD Mark Sanchez to Stephen Hill for the Jets.
Waivers alert: Rams WR Chris Givens already had 3 catches for 85 yards serving as Danny Amendola's replacement.
Matt Ryan and Tony Romo seem to be impersonating each other today.
Jermaine Gresham rambles into the end zone on a 55-yard completion from Andy Dalton for the first touchdown of the day.
Greg the Leg Zuerlein nails a 48-yard 'Chip Shot' to give the rams a lead over Miami.
Raiders Joselio Hanson picks off Matt Ryan for Oakland's first INT of the season. The only other team without one is DET (facing Vick).

#RL WR Santonio Holmes' injury was a foot injury, not a knee.
Send us your game questions w/ #asktheJets. #EA will be live on http://t.co/l8qPeLg6  in 20 min to review game w/ guests
RT @SNYtv: Tune to JETS POST GAME LIVE immediately after the game #snyjets
#RL Robert Malone punt blked by Larry Grant. First Jets punt blocked since 2008, Charlie Anderson of MIA blocking Reggie Hodges punt.
#RL Akers FG makes it 27-0--largest deficit in home game in which the Jets were being shut out since 37-0 loss to BUF in 1989 season finale.
#RL Just announced: WR Santonio Holmes (knee) is out for the rest of this game.
#RL Robert Malone gets off 43-yd punt, 5.19-second hang time, Ted Ginn fair-catches at SF-32.
#EA Santonio Holmes is being carted off the field.  The left knee is the concern. 49ers now up 24-0, have 4 takeaways.
#RL Longest fumble-return TD by a NYJ opponent since CB Rashard Anderson went 94 yds in 2001 at CAR in "the Shrek Game," won by Jets 13-12.
#RL Carlos Rogers returns fumble by WR Santonio Holmes after catch 51 yds for TD to give SF a 24-0 lead with 14:46 to play...
#RL Jets have allowed 8 TDs on 11 red zone opportunites by opponents this season, including Frank Gore's 2-yd run to make it 17-0.
#RL Jets' last 98-yards-plus drive: Game 15, 2011, vs. Giants, 99 yards, TD.
#EA Jets D has been good on 3rd down, holding the Niners to just 2 of 8.
#RL Rookie DT Quinton Coples makes his second tackle for loss of game, this time Frank Gore loss of 1 yard. Third down...
#RL Jets go 3-and-out, their third such series of the game. 7 possessions: 4 punts, 3 giveaways.
#EA Uphill climb when you turn it over 3 times.  Akers misses from 40 yards after D holds and it’s still 10-0.  Will that be a spark?
#RL David Akers 40-yd FG attempt to open 3rd qtr goes wide right. He's now 5-for-10 career FG tries vs. Jets.
#RL Jets trail at the half in yardage (210-83), first downs (14-4), takeaways (2-0) and on the scoreboard.
#RL Akers 36-yd FG is good to end the half. Akers now career 5-for-9 on FG tries vs. Jets.
#RL Personal foul on SF's Aldon Smith after the play. First down Jets--their 11th first down by penalty this season--at SF 33.
#EA Good hold by the defense.  Jets have great field position at the SF 47.  Trailing 7-0 with 2:29 left before the half.
#RL Robert Malone's 3rd punt: 41-yd punt, 4.90-second hang time, Ted Ginn fair catch at SF 11.
#RL Sacks were the Jets' first in two games, Pace's first of the season, Thomas' first since 2010.
#RL Jets injuries: TE Dedrick Epps (knee), FB John Conner (hamstring), return to this game is questionable for both.
#RL Back-to-back sacks by Bryan Thomas and Calvin Pace forces SF to settle for 55-yd David Akers FG try, wide right. Jets ball at their 45.
#EA Back-to-back sacks.  BT and then C. Pace as the veteran OLBs step up here at the Met.
#EA SF lives off takeaways — were a plus 28 last year.  Niners take over after the fumble with great field position.  D needs a stand.
#RL Jets' 7-0 deficit is the first time in 6 quarters that they've trailed at home this season.
#RL Niners drive 68 yds to Colin Kaepernick 7-yd keeper TD. Kaepernick 2 carries, 24 yds, Jets run def has given up 104 yds on 12 carries.
#EA SF had 88 yards rushing in the 1st quarter — 45 of them came on two plays: Kaepernick for 17 and Manningham for 28.

RT @mowilkerson: Great team win today nobody said it had to be pretty #jetnation
Mark Sanchez: “We knew it was going to be a tough one and I’m just proud of the way we pulled it out.”
Rex Ryan: “We kept hanging in there and like the team we are we kept fighting all the way until the end.”
Rex Ryan: “Every win in this league is a great win and they’re tough to get.”
@mberges_10 That is correct, Marcus.
@BarnetBlondie92 Enjoy the rest of your day, Shannon.
@MissT_Tista It was a tough battle, Tiorys, but we pulled it out.
@MzJennG It was a hard-fought battle and a win we needed, Jennifer.
@ChiPhiBrent We pulled it out in a tight game, Brent!
#EA The Jets are 2-1 and 2-0 in the AFC East.  Gutsy win.
#EA Tone Time.  That's 9 receptions for 147 yards.  In FG range.
#RL Dan Carpenter, who had hit his first 13 FGs vs. Jets dating to 2008, has now missed 2 of his last 3 tries, from 41, to win it from 48.
@No_Chainz We appreciate the support.
@Banks81 It's crunch time right now, Dave.
@lettybuxton It's a close one, Leticia.
#RL Santonio Holmes now 8 catches for 109 yds, his first 100-yd receiving game since 11/21/10 vs. Houston Texans.
#RL Jets, Dolphins going to OT. It's the Jets' first overtime game since winning back-to-back in OT @ DET, @ CLE in 2010.
#EA Jets and Dolphins head to overtime.  It is 20-20 in South Florida.
@marykate_goff We can't let up yet Mary Kate.
@traynorBADGER07 Big touchdown, Matthew!
@brebabs @jonSCOTTathan Thanks for spreading the word, Breanne.
#RL WR Stephen Hill has a hamstring injury. His return to this game is questionable.
#RL Robert Malone 4.59-hang time on a drop punt that Isaiah Trufant catches at MIA 5-yd line. Jets still trail 17-13 with 7:13 left.
#RL Dan Carpenter misses from 48 yds out. That's Carpenter's first miss vs. Jets after going 13-for-13 from 2008 to present.
#EA Last 2 Red Zone trips for the Jets – 3 points.  But plenty of time left to win this thing.
#RL Jeremy Kerley 66-yd catch-n-run longest non-scoring reception by Jets WR since Neil ODonnell-to-Wayne Chrebet (70 yds, vs MIA, 1997).
#RL After 1st-and-goal at MIA 1, Jets settle for Nick Folk 20-yd FG (5-for-5 this season), now trail Dolphins 17-13, 13:29 left.
@IllestHenry You can find them here, Henry- http://t.co/Rnk1BV8N.
#RL Richard Marshall interferes with Santonio Holmes just over GL. For Holmes, that's 7 penalties forced against opposing DBs last 2 wks.
@Jnat675 That was a great 66-yd connection, Justin.
@Rubzzz123 Jeremy made a great run after the catch, Jeremy.
#EA Jets will have a chance to tie this one up when the 4th quarter commences.  That 66-yarder to Kerley was a monster play.
@Banks81 Great play, Dave.
#RL Dolphins 2nd 1-yd TD run of the day, this one by FB Jorvorskie Lane for his 1st NFL TD, puts MIA up 17-10.
#RL Darrelle Revis has a knee injury. He's out for remainder of this game.
#EA Very scary when you see Darrelle Revis down.  Hopefully No. 24 is OK.  Kyle Wilson takes over on the outside.   Revis being carted off.
#RL Dolphins starting on their own 20 after Robert Malone punt. MIA average field position last 7 drives: their own 14-yard line.
#RL Jets had 4 takeaways in their first 3 quarters this season, then none in their next 7 quarters, then 2 on consecutive plays today.
#EA Sanchez's 2nd INT of the day takes points off the board.  The Jets and Dolphins remained tied at 10.  Red Zone turnover is tough.
@Jenna_Nicolee Thanks for the support, Jenna!
@Deano_Jets88 2 big turnovers can turn the game around, Callum.
#EA Another turnover.  Wow.  Revis with the recovery.  Jets in business again.
@IRGrubsy Great way to start the 2nd half, Ian!
#RL Also it's Landry's first INT-return TD of his 6-year NFL career.
@DMaceranka All tied up.
#RL LaRon Landry picks off Ryan Tannehill, returns 18 yds for gametying TD. Second Jets INT-return TD this season (Cromartie vs. BUF).
#EA There is that turnover!  Landry pick-six!
#RL MIA RB Reggie Bush has a knee injury. His return to this game is questionable.
#EA Jets could really use a takeaway.  Dolphins have this 7-point lead and the TD followed a turnover.
@CBROWNDAGOD Pressuring the QB is a key to winning this game. We know we need to turn it up.
@d_nugent We know we need to play better to win this game, David.
#RL Dolphins lead in yardage (156-114), takeaways (1-0), Jets ahead in 1st downs (10-9), possession time (16:03-13:57).
#RL Jets trail Dolphins at half, 10-3. It's Dolphins' first halftime lead in their last nine home games against the Jets.
@dormaechea Thanks for rooting us on, David.
#RL Nick Folk, who opened last season with 11-for-11 on FG tries, is now 4-for-4 this season.
#RL Rookie WR Stephen Hill can't hold 3rd-down TD pass in end zone, Nick Folk comes on for 33-yd FG, cuts MIA lead to 10-3, 1:50 left 1H.
@ItsCanCan9 This has been a good-looking drive.
#EA Maybe the direct snap to Tebow for a 4th down conversion will get the Jets going.
#RL Personal punt protector Tim Tebow takes direct punt snap on 4th-and-3 at Jets 25, gets 5 yds for 1st down.
@therick4444 We know we need to turn it up to win this game, Rick.
#RL Dan Carpenter 21-yd FG gives Dolphins 10-0 lead, their largest lead over the Jets in the teams' last 7 games at Sun Life Staidum.
#EA Jets in a 10-0 hole after Dan Carpenter's 21-yard FG.
@_brittschneider We'll see you at MetLife Stadium next week, Brittany.
@Beautymark99 Happy birthday!
#RL Santonio Holmes draws illegal contact on Richard Marshall down left sideline. That's 6 penalties drawn by Tone vs. opponents last 2 wks.

@BeYouTheFULLest Thanks for the support.
#RL Mark Sanchez trying to find WR Clyde Gates, throws INT to CB Richard Marshall. Sanchez's 4th INT last 5 quarters vs. MIA.
#RL WR Santonio Holmes draws pass interference on CB Nolan Carroll. Holmes' 5th penalty drawn against opponents last 2 games.

@CAD5000 in lockouts (plural) have been addressed.Goodell's stance explored this summer. But, Gumbels exact wording-as KB said- made a story
@CAD5000 Fact is, it was a story because the plantation line. Stern's been called egocentric before on our show. Commish/Player relations...
@CAD5000 kb said precisely that-that invoking plantation prohibits the conversation from going deeper. Same was said was on PTI.
@CAD5000 What do you mean? JA/Bob said Stern's gone thru measures for claim to be untrue. W/KB said Gumbel's language undercut his argument

Watching Yankee locker room celebration makes me miss not having had the champagne celebrations in our locker rooms after our big wins
@riggo44 no apology necessary. Keep up the great work! Love hearing your perspective.

Fantasy Update: Down 10 pts heading into Monday Night...Vikings defense scores 16 pts to give Troy's Boys a 3 pt win.  3-1 on the year.
@twitemily Coach Joe was telling me about Lady's Locker Room today at lunch.  Said it was fun...Hope he actually spoke about football!
@yourcuppycake No. Coach Joe owns a sports bar in town & is also doing some local TV & radio.
Just finished lunch w/ longtime Cowboys special team's coach Joe Avezzano. It was good to catch up. He's doing great!
@jffcrmr good point!
What an exciting finish! Can't question the Broncos defense now. They kept the game close & delivered with game on the line.
We're about 12 minutes from kickoff in Denver. Enjoy the game everybody!
Getting workout in before heading over to Invesco Field for Broncos/Cowboys.  I love football Sundays!
@jsherm916 Broke my leg...Jamille Holloway came in and led the Sooners to national championship.  I transferred to UCLA.
Watching OU/Miami game reminds me of breaking my leg in '85.  Some great games between these 2 teams in the late 80's.
Tomorrow's Cowboys/Broncos matchup should provide clearer picture of the Broncos.  Quality of opponents questioned in 3-0 start.
Anyone else get annoyed with those that OVER tweet? I'm not THAT interested in what ANYONE is doing!

Getting ready to put Moose Johnston's son thru some QB drills...then on to the Cowboys/Panthers MNF game tonight.
Days like today in Dallas make me not miss SoCal so much. Hope you're enjoying the weather if you're here!
Headed to the gym. Much needed after the weekend in Foxboro...Luciano's, pizza, ice cream!
Rain beginning to fall but doesn't look to affect the QB's...at least not in pregame warmups.
@MJThrill Ate at Luciano's Friday night. We eat there every trip to Foxboro...OUTSTANDING!
After 2 picture perfect days thunderstorms roll into Foxboro. The type of weather I always feared as a player...couldn't throw a wet ball!

I thought Irv was great on DWTS last night. He'll be needing the call-in votes so let's help 'em out.
Impressive win today by the Saints. Thought Kevin Kolb was "OK". Didn't get much help from defense or special teams.
@jdkeese My nephew played with Tre Newton in Pop Warner.  He was a RB then too but never would have thought he'd still be a RB in college!
Just remembered the Texas/Texas Tech game was on!  Mack Brown was my Offensive Coordinator freshman year at OU - Go Horns!
Wrapping up preparations for Eagles/Saints over a turkey burger from room service - and you thought this was glamorous!
A beautiful day in Philadelphia...Eagles/Saints should be quite a game tomorrow! 1 p.m. ET
Just landed in Philadelphia. Heading to Eagles practice...meetings with coaches & players later.
@AudacityofHype Yards per Rush, Yards per Pass, Total 1st Downs, 3rd Down %, Points Scored minus Return TD's, Red Zone Efficiency, Turnovers

For those that have asked, I have this week's Aikman Efficiency Ratings. Would post here but not sure best way to do it. Any ideas?
Great to get workout out of the way 1st thing in the morning! Sporting News Radio taping in an hour.
Big week 1 fantasy win for Troy's Boys.  I guess drafting Drew Brees was a good pick after all!
@michaelstrahan Stra- You're livin' the good life...I should have learned how to rush the passer!
@fredmaidment Wasn't dissing Herschel whatsoever. It was a joke because so much made of that trade. Herschel is a friend...lighten up.
Congratulations to UCLA on a really good road win @ Tennessee & a 2-0 start.
A shout out to stevallica.com for handling the graphics design on my twitter page.  Thanks Steve!
@bonnied16 good luck to Zachary! Don't be afraid to put a golf club in his hand either! LOL
@jerryn Green Bay would have had the #1 pick if they had lost the final game in '88.
Make sure to follow @NFLONFOX. They'll have news & behind the scenes access from FOX game sites & the pregame crew all season long!
Making media rounds in NYC for Campbell's Soup. Just finished Fox & Friends & Al Roker on Weather Channel. Jim Rhome & NFL Net later today.
@BrianDH83 We've got Redskins @ Giants this week. Maybe the best season opener we've had with NFC East clash.
@michaelstrahan Stra- You can take him!  He doesn't handle pressure very well...LOL (that'll stir 'em up!!)
@effbot Aikman Efficiency Ratings will begin following week 1.
Enjoying last weekend before NFL season kicks off. Some really good college games over the holiday weekend too. Go UCLA!
@victorandmatt Leigh Steinberg is still a very close friend but no longer represents me.  Jordan Bazant from The Agency is my representative
Interested in hearing what you want to hear from the broadcasters while watching an NFL game. Looking forward to week 1.
Change of plans for fantasy team following quite a reaction to "Men of Troy".  The new name will be "Troy's Boys"  Enjoy the game tonight.
Thanks for the replies...going with "Men of Troy". Several suggested that one.
@Derrick1972 Michael Turner
Need a name for my fantasy team...suggestions?
@jacobu puh-leaze!
Mel Kiper loves my draft!
RB Cadillac Williams...either he or Derrick Ward is going to get A LOT of carries this year!
Jake Delhomme
@tormike that was my thinking too.
8th Round: Hines Ward
@JoeSteelerfan we have 15 teams...players are flying off the board.
Vikings Defense
This is new to me...you all are killing my draft! LOL
6th Round: WR: Lee Evans
5th round: RB Derrick Ward
Not many liked my Dallas Clark selection. What position for my next pick?
4th round: Dallas Clark
3rd round: RB Ronnie Brown
2nd round pick: Randy Moss
With the 9th pick I took Drew Brees
Brees or Andre Johnson
Drew Brees or Tom Brady
Our Fox Fantasy Draft is about to begin. I've got the 9th pick...any suggestions from the fantasy gurus?
@conradh That would be pretty cool for sure!
@Humble63 if there was a Mt. Rushmore for QB's I wouldn't argue with those four but what about Joe Montana?
http://twitpic.com/fd20v - Tampa's practice facility is quite impressive...including the lobby honoring the '02 Super Bowl Champions.
I thought Dallas was humid...it's a dry heat compared to Tampa, FL!!
Off to Tampa for final preseason game Thursday night on Fox...Bucs v. Dolphins
@slaterfan Good question...in all the years I've known Irv I've NEVER seen him dance! Don't count him out though...hardest working guy ever!
@720acdc Wingstop wings are the BEST...no joke!! If you go don't forget the fries...delicious! It's why I run every day!
Why is it u can't go to Costco without buying 3x more than u need?!
Updated Twitter home page.  Check it out & tell me what you think.
Sleep over was great fun but we're all exhausted and calling it an early night.
great 4 mile run...now the margaritas will be even better at dinner!
The Big Green Egg is as good as advertised...ribs are AWESOME!
@JoeSteelerfan LOL!!! That's all the motivation needed!
Trying to get motivated to go for a run
@bonnied16 making my own...baby back ribs.  My girls love 'em!
@mytweeny It's a smoker that looks like a BIG GREEN EGG...hence the name.

@DalDubya too lengthy to tweet but the discussion has taken up much of the morning session.
At Fox Sports seminar in NY. Mavs owner Mark Cuban gave a very insightful presentation on social networking & its impact on sports.
HOF did an excellent job on the Lamar Hunt Super Bowl Gallery. Ribbon-cutting ceremony this a.m. Especially good to see Norma Hunt.
@westcott604 ANY day on the ocean is a GREAT day! Kind of like golf in that way.
Great weekend in South Bend w Billy Cannon, Pat Fitzgerald, Randall McDaniel, Don McPherson, Jay Novacek & others!

To all those that made Father's Day wishes...thank you. It was a great day!!
Six Flags with kids today. The Titan is a ridiculously amazing roller coaster! My 7 yr old loved it too...great fun!
Will be visiting Cowboys Stadium again tonight. This time with daughters in tow for Jonas Bros concert..isn't it Father's Day weekend?
Petco Park...what a great venue. Can't beat America's past time in San Diego in June.
Hoping to see some of you Padres fans @ Petco Park tomorrow night!
Norman Brinker was a true titan of the restaurant industry. His impact on those he touched is enormous. We will miss our friend.
Don't get me wrong, I like the Lakers & I appreciate what they've done. Simply as a neutral fan I would have liked a game 7.
Watching the Lakers/Magic & thinking about how good this series could have been.
20 years late to graduate but it was worth it to have my wife & daughters there with me. A proud Bruin for sure!
@CourtWestcott she needs to go with Ally. Ally picked 3 out 4 winners a couple weeks ago!
On campus @ UCLA...brings back great memories.
In Los Angeles for UCLA commencement tomorrow. It only took 20 years! Better late than never...right?!
Nice Padres win last night v. Dodgers...great outing for Kevin Correia. Looking forward to attending the game June 17th.
Just wrapped taping for the Wingstop commercial. Should be a fun spot.
Getting set to film a Wingstop commercial with Jerry Jones today.
I got bad info last night. As most of u now know, our Friars LOST in 18 innings : (
Padres win in the 18th!!!!
Padres in the 18th inning in a 6-6 tie v. Arizona!
Beautiful day @ Southern Hills in Tulsa, Ok...feels good to be back in my old stomping grounds...even if just 4 a day.
Frustrated with how terribly inconsistent my golf game has become...more practice needed!
As Jimmy Johnson would say "How 'bout them Padres"!!!!
British Open qualifier in Plano, TX today. These guys are good! ...And they're having to qualify to get in the Open!
...wondering how many twitterers are out at the Byron Nelson Golf Tournament today.
Another solid pitching effort by Geer leads the way for the Friars 8th consecutive win!
@jacobu "WE"? C'mon Johnnie!
Great pitching by Jake Peavy last night. Padres on a 7 game win streak!

@kaj33 Thank you Captain!  Hope life is good.  Go Bruins!!!
Great golf weekend with the boys...even if we did have to play the final round in the rain. 2nd place finish for me.
Big golf weekend in Dallas with some former UCLA Bruin teammates; Norrie, Warnick & Whitenight.
Happy Mother's Day to all the Moms!
Why is it that in charity golf tournament there is someone in every fivesome that thinks he's Tiger Woods?
At Tom Coughlin's Jay Fund Golf Tournament in Jacksonville. Pretty obvious how meaningful this is to the Coach.
At poker tournament with Irvin, Emmitt & Moose. Lucky for me they were much better football players.
Now that the NFL Draft is over, what are we supposed to do until preseason starts in August?
I miss football this time of year but it sure is nice being home with the family on weekends. Girls started softball today...good stuff!
A lot of people questioned Mark Sanchez's decision to go pro. At least financially, it was a good decision on his part.
Look for lots of grades tomorrow on how teams did in NFL Draft.  Ridiculous! NO ONE will know how anyone did for at least a couple of years
Stafford picking up the tab at our next dinner.
Enjoying Jon Gruden's insight on NFL Network's draft coverage.
Happy for Matthew Stafford...hard to believe it was 20 years ago today I was with the Commissioner as the #1 pick.
I'm focused on football this week with the NFL draft but a tough 1-0 Padres loss in extra innings...good pitching Chris Young!
In every draft there's a "best" QB but does that mean in every draft there's a "franchise" QB?
Anxious week for those collegiate players awaiting this weekend's NFL Draft!
Padres do it again in the 9th!!!
Well, quite a battle but won the tournament on the last hole...almost as exciting as some of our wins in the '90's!
Leading by 1 shot going into final round of tournament.
Great comeback victory by the Padres last night...off to a great start!
I, Along with millions of football fans across the country, will miss hearing John Madden...the greatest color analyst of our time.
leading the tournament after 1.5 days
Gearing up for the Ancala Member/Guest Golf Tournament in Scottsdale, AZ. Hopefully my partner, Dale Hellestrae, shows up with his quest ...

WHY is @ESPN_Colin calling wrestling fans booger eaters? I will storm that studio, pull that lil' hoodie over his head and drop kick his...

After seeing the Dr. Pepper 10 ad (tagline: "it's not for women"), I drank it anyways. Now I have mommy issues and fear of commitment. Great
I'm gonna run Monday Night Raw!!! Oh wait....
So Sheamus and Cena stick with HHH. What will Punk do? #watchingrawandmnf
Why does baseball force us to choose between NFL and the playoffs? They can never, EVER win that fight.
Prepping for the show today with my buddy @ESPN_Colin. I'm thinking about getting my sing on! Oh u didn't know? I write songs. Be warned.
LOVE seeing Kathryn Tappen kick butt on NHL Network. Once worked together and the powers never gave her a legit shot. #suitsdontalwaysknow

Back in NYC and headed to CT. Delays couldn't  keep this steel trap down. Missing my little Leroy Jenkins. (and maybe @ESPN_Colin a tad)
What's the deal in NYC? Did a breeze blow over LGA? Maybe a single crack of lightening? Delayed at least an hour on runway in ATL. LGA=soft

Huge congrats to @crystalthune on winning week 1 of our fanalyst contest! U sounded and looked great! Expect u on tv in the future!

This pic is from where pops lives. Insanity. RT @Vreeke5: Hole #13 on Live Oak @ESPN_Michelle http://t.co/Z59DxfN
Crazy pics coming in constantly. Evacuations and helicopters using golf course ponds to try and stop fires. Bob Beadle remains cool.
Without knowing anyone involved, I'm beyond sad for those lost in the Russian plane crash. For those who fear flying, it's incomprehensible.
With the Texas fires closing in on family and friends, I'm thinking about all of you. Bob Beadle doesn't get worried. And Bob is worried.
Loving the WWE updates guys! Do not fret, for I have been wearing my "best in the world" tee while frolicking thru Italia. vivailrevoluzione

"Hey it's DWade! I'm taking a personal day. I'll be back tomorrow" - Wade's VoiceMail
What is the ONE WORD for DWade tonight?
Hey DWade, the game started an hour ago. No big deal, it's just the playoffs.
This dude got Tony Parker's face shaved into the back of his head -> http://t.co/wlDzBwlH #Spurs
"I'm glad Steve Blake took the last shot." - Things Kobe WON'T say.
Who Ya Got!? #Lakers #Thunder
The same Dirk that just got swept? RT @83_LMG @SportsNation Adopt some Dirk like skills
For the Lakers to win tonight, Kobe needs to _________
20 point leads are too common in these playoffs. #playsomeD
"You STILL think we look old?" - The Spurs
"You shoot it, I'll be a decoy." - LeBron James
You HAVE to make your free throws.
Pacers v. Heat feels like JV v. Varsity.
"WE are the BIG-3" - OKC
We asked about the BEST, not 10th best. RT @Strout9 @SportsNation what about David west and granger.
TRUE or FALSE: KD and Westbrook are the BEST duo.
James Harden enters. KD was nice enough to give him a handshake.
Little brothers always have ONE in them. #Sixers
sooo you're saying there's a chance! RT @rcharnovich divide by 2....carry the 1....multiply by TRUE
TRUE or FALSE: The Celtics look old.
Didn't know this was possible. RT @espn LeBron and D-Wade flat out dominated the 4th.
This is NOT a typo.  Clippers advance!
Z-Bo gets the win. Today IS Friday. Game 7  in Memphis on Sunday. #Grizzlies #Clippers
How awesome would it be if the Grizzlies rocked these jerseys tonight? -> http://t.co/5nJpKhsN
On the court for the Lakers: Ebanks, Hill, Morris, Eyenga and Murphy. WHO? See you for Game 7.
Lesson learned tonight. Make your free throws late.
MJ 'Flu Game' was in the NBA Finals. Kobe 'Flu Game' is the FIRST Round. Let's not mix the two.
________ forces Game 7 tonight. #Bulls #Hawks #Nuggets
Tim Tebow should really have changed his dogs name to _________.
Shaq, Snoop, Jay-Z, Charles Barkley, AND Arnold were all in the studio yesterday -> http://t.co/BPhLmWoL
"We were down 18 after the 1st in Game 1. We're FINE!" - Clippers Fans
Teams have been known to "flip a switch" in the playoffs. Miami has a NOS button attached to that switch.
TRUE or FALSE: The Knicks will see Game 6.
You mad? Kobe's 43pts is NOT enough!
Bulls live to see Game 6. Any chance DRose will be available for that one?
Define 'beast mode': Josh Hamilton 5-for-5, 4 HRs, 8 RBI
Maybe using a swiffer would have been? RT @ducharme88 How can sweeping the defending champs not be more dominant!? #ThunderUp
More dominant sweep: Thunder over Mavs OR Spurs over Jazz?
Only the Spurs can make hockey THIS exciting!
May 7th needs to be a holiday: Jordan over Ehlo. Miller drops 8 pts in 11 seconds. Allen Iverson asks "practice!?"
Were you shocked to see Bieber in the ring with Mayweather's entourage? http://t.co/vRdNglpF
It's the 4th Quarter in Denver. Do you know where Tim Tebow is?
Boston Three Party! Rondo and Pierce on a different level!
Rondo has this affect on people. http://t.co/byCHPMib
Put your brooms away, Melo decided to show up for Game 4.
Chicago at least you have the Cubs? White Sox? see you at kick-off!
RT @ESPYS: YES! RT @RobRiggle This is how @teamvic, @ShutupLutz and I prepare for the @ESPYS! http://t.co/Z7u1kv8K
Changing of the guard? Thunder up 3-0 on Mavs!
"We could really use Lamar Odom right about now" - Nobody in Dallas
LAL not even #1 in your fantasy?! RT @dbrockman2 False. Bynum/Kobe have Lakers firmly No. 2
TRUE or FALSE: Thunder are the 2nd best team in the West.
The Heat - Knicks game was close. Then they played the 4th quarter.
Who ya got?! #Knicks #Heat
TRUE or FALSE: The Knicks are waaay better without Amar'e Stoudemire.
