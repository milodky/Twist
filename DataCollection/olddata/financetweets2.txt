@jd_flynn_57 playing very well with their backup QB. A lesson that has been missed by the Jets.
The #Jets are playing this game as if they are tied instead of being down 24 points. #NFLTT

The problem with many of the Romney stock names is he better win OR ELSE!!  These coal stocks are way overheated.
People saying i 'm paid by Obama; people saying i am paid by Romney.. I am paid by neither; i favor higher stock prices. That's my agenda
@boonepickens Major League Baseball, Lions-Bears, Nah...They play every year, don't get these debates that often!
The defense plays are so difficult these days because Congress can't agree on anything.  So no money for  new ships/tanks./planes..
#CNBC2012--Some crackerjack ideas for this debate. Remember  if Romney talks energy independence, he needs coal and nat gas--$CNX- a twofer
