http://twitpic.com/2qunn - I just got challenged to a dance-off by my friend's kid. Sadly, I lost.
At a friend's house and when I walked by a cactus it poked me. Personally, I find that unnecessary and a bit immature.
Dear chapstick fairy: I feel special when you secretly visit, but me losing my chapstick every 1-2 weeks is getting expensive
Hanging w/ @garyvee in the back of the room getting ready to speak at @tonyrobbins #UBMS biz conf about customer svc & company culture!
To save on costs, we installed bunk desks at Zappos. It's actually not as uncomfortable as it looks - http://bit.ly/zbunkdesk

"Being a leader doesn't mean everyone will follow you. It means setting a higher standard for yourself" - @tonyrobbins #UBMS biz conference
Dinner at CUT, a Wolfgang Puck steakhouse. Cool name, definitely much catchier than if they named the restaurant Cowgang Puck.
Busy day! Great lunch w/ @tonyrobbins after he toured our offices, @livestrongceo coming now for tour, meeting, then dinner!
"In the pursuit of knowledge, something is added every day. In the pursuit of enlightenment, something is dropped every day" -Lao Tzu
Just walked past a mannequin. And as with all mannequins in my peripheral vision, it freaked me out b/c I thought someone was staring at me
Finally landed in Vegas after the plane circled around a few times. I think that's what they like to do before going to sleep for the night.
I hope we can bring this to @zappos offices one day - it makes pizza from scratch in 3 mins! - http://bit.ly/pizzamachine

Just realized I left 2 shirts in the closet when I checked out of my hotel this morning. I guess the maids will be well dressed tomorrow
Thinking that people who reply-to-all indiscriminately should work on trying to reduce their carbon copy footprint.
http://twitpic.com/2fzoj - On Virgin America flight. For $5 I can offset my carbon footprint. Will try it out

http://twitpic.com/2eyvk - Calories don't really exist if you don't think about them, right?
Ivanka Trump: "Most important thing is to love what you do". Also, father taught her "To whom much is given, much is expected"
At Caesar's listening to Ivanka Trump speak before my speech. She gave organizer hard time for not holding conf at Trump hotel next door :)
Twitter's 140 character limit just goes to show that it's the little things that count. #verydeepthoughts

Happy birthday Twitter! Like most 3 yr olds, u make me feel happy, sad, surprised, overwhelmed. But in the end I still love u.
Had breakfast mtg w/ Zappos board member. Neither of us are morning people. Naptime now (at least for me, I don't track his sleeping habits)
Finished important mtg to determine where tooth fairy keeps all the teeth. Don't know, but it's probably pretty frakin' scary
Weird, someone has been secretly filling our trash dumpster at Zappos w/ LOTS & LOTS of newspapers. Maybe it's the newspaper fairy?
Happy Friday & happy first day of Spring everyone! - “No winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn.” - Hal Borland

About to speak at conf. Spilled Coke on left leg of jeans, so poured some water on right leg so looks like the denim fade.
At Austin airport. Thought about pinching TSA for not wearing green today but decided I really wasn't in the mood to go to jail
So @tempo finishes story & cab driver promptly turns music off. Eerily silent now. Driver is either subtle hinter or on twitter

Austin is such a great town. Just finished filming for Revision3, now grabbing dinner. My keynote at #sxws is at 2 PM tomorrow!
Flight to Austin delayed & overbooked. Airline needs 2 people to take later flight. They can't fool me, the flight is already later. #sxsw
Busy busy day! Didn't notice any @Zappos employees doing the robot dance at the office today - http://bit.ly/zrobot

@pleesexplain We appreciate your interest in our country. Come here, see the sights and spend money please.

@toffergrant it's incredible to watch. And then to fathom the actual cost!! Can we get a do-over?
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch Work smarter then...
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch Are they average? There are 314 million people in the U.S. What should the "average" person look like?
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch I'm pretty average.
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch I AM the average citizen (and I used to work for the other guy in our tweet chat ;)
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch You know what people do...they row in the opposite direction so you & your hard work goes nowhere.
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch It would be nice if that's the way America worked. Maybe we wouldn't be teetering on financial collapse then.
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch That's one way to see it.
To understand the financial abyss America is facing, go to http://t.co/nQxLmjSR & see for yourself. Ignorance is not an excuse!
@moorehn That really sucks! I bet it was just replaced too...
@rupertmurdoch We either start rowing together or it's every man for himself. I'm happy to pick up an oar if you are.
@YoungCarin Start w/ a heaping portion of the right attitude & mix it w/ focus & a plan of action. Turn on good music while cooking.

@DevCleary Great to have you joining us tonight. I appreciate it. #smallbizpgh
@bearclawjackson Start by learning how to use social media properly and build your foundation. Slow & steady wins the race. #smallbizpgh
@bearclawjackson It's never too early to learn about social media for biz. Find internships, connect w/ potential employers. #smallbizpgh
A8c: Find out info about prospects on LinkedIn...common interests & connections. You can also get info on competitors. #smallbizpgh
A8b: Selling is 90% preparation/10% presentation. LinkedIn is a big help getting you to the 90% mark. #smallbizpgh
Q8: LinkedIn is a incredible tool for networking! You can join niche groups, ask questions, give answers.  #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz Happy birthday!! #smallbizpgh
If you know a small biz owner who could use advice tell them to follow #SmallBizPgh and join us every month 7 – 8pm.    #smallbizpgh
A7b: A good mix includes events (be a panelist/speaker if you can) + online discussions (Twitter/LinkedIn).     #smallbizpgh
@MamaBritt Well deserved.
A7: Consistency is the name of the game. Effective networking takes time. Don’t force the conversation & be genuine.     #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: Every experience & failure teaches lessons. Pay attn to the lessons. You will be more successful in biz. #smallbizpgh
@fleejack Great question for @lindahandleyinc. I always suggest local chapters of @SCOREMentors @ASBDC & @SBAgov  #smallbizpgh
@JodiOkun Ask a dealbreaking question upfront (it usually involves $ or expectations). If you don't get the right answer...run. #smallbizpgh
@DiversityWoman Partial list @rieva, @karenkerrigan, @barbaraweltman, @JodiOkun, @mamabritt, @lindahandleyinc, @marketingedge #smallbizpgh
@DiversityWoman I have a list of SMB experts on my Twitter page. Lots of smart, sharp women thought leaders there. #smallbizpgh
@RupiPANAICH It's about engagement. Put info on your FB page that customers/prospects want to see. Then invite them over ;) #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter Only partner with other people/companies if they help can you in achieving your goal. Otherwise, why bother? #smallbizpgh
RT @fleejack: here is an example of the #eyeme app @Abercrombie http://t.co/PVGRdWxg  How #smallbizpgh can make your own ads #smallbizpgh
RT @Rieva: @brianmoran Agreed. Participating in social media essential for small business. But be smart--go where your clients are
A6b: Partner with winners. People/companies that have a successful track record. Don't partner with a longshot. #smallbizpgh
A6: Partner w/ any person or biz that can help you reach your goal. Avoid wild goose chases & dead ends at all costs.  #smallbizpgh

@Rieva @bridges4biz now add #smallbizpgh so everyone can read that. Excellent point.
@HowardLewinter Like Dr. Seuss once said "sometimes the questions are complicated & the answers are easy." #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: Ask yourself: How does your competition use the internet and social media? #smallbizpgh
A5b: the rule with any #smallbiz is "when in doubt, ask." If you're not sure about customers using SM, ask them. #smallbizpgh
A5: It depends on the #smallbiz. Start by asking current clients LOTS of questions on how they use the Internet for business.  #smallbizpgh
@fleejack And that doesn't include my family! #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter It's as if you come to a party bearing gifts... #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: If you participate in social media and you provide relevant content there will be customers who find you. #smallbizpgh
A4c: Go to where the chats are taking place. If you go to a SM site & no one in your business is using it…leave! #smallbizpgh
A4b: Once you find your potential customers, see if industry experts use the same site. What about competitors? #smallbizpgh
A4: Ask them what SM tools they use for biz. Also ask current customers. Then, learn how to engage w/ them on those sites. #smallbizpgh
@fleejack First find one expert whom you trust, then ask them who they "follow." Also check LinkedIn for recommendations. #smallbizpgh
A3c: A good #entrepreneur is someone who absolutely loves what they do. That love is what carries them through the bad times. #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter All the NY Giants fans just "groaned." #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A3b: Someone who knows the bitter taste of defeat & works like hell never to taste it again. #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A3: By “good” I assume you mean successful. It’s someone who understands the risks and plans accordingly.  #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter Great point Howard. #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: After social media, how about some old fashioned selling? Contact your potential buyer & present yourself. #smallbizpgh
Good questions so far... #smallbizpgh
A2c: Check out industry/community sites. Network w/ like-minded #smallbiz. What marketing works for them? Fewer mistakes 4 you! #smallbizpgh
A2b: Find out which SM Tools your customers/prospects are using. No sense in building a FB page if no one visits it. #smallbizpgh
@gouterbridge Thanks Glen. Every #smallbiz should be checking out #eyeme. It's next generation of social media! #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A2: Social Media! Your biggest investment is time. Your customers & potential customers are online. Go find them. #smallbizpgh
@briantippens Thanks B. Hope you are well. #smallbizpgh
A1c: Many #smallbiz think social media is a fad & it won’t help their biz. It’s a “means to an end;” Get in the game. #smallbizpgh
A1b: No “real” biz plan. #Sandy is a stark reminder that #smallbiz WILL be interrupted. Have a plan “A” and plan “B.” #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A1: Cash Flow! Too many #smallbiz owners don’t have enough of a safety net to protect them when A/R goes net 90+ #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter Great to see you here Howard. #smallbizpgh
@fleejack Social Media could be as important as oxygen or water to some #smallbiz. It's the way we do biz now. #smallbizpgh

To the BusinessInsider  folks who like my page generation, especially Joe W, my Boswell, I like being right more than being controversial
If i predicted a landslide for Romney, Business Insider would get 80,000 more pageviews and be ebitda positive that day
RT @SoDakLiberal:  The Romney people are just generally confused.-j if i predicted a landslide for Romney they would call me a genius.
If you ever say anyone might win, the other side decides you are against them. I think the Giants will win it all, but i hate them!!!
The Romney people seem confused--but the electorals aren't the same as the popular..
Jim Cramer is an idiot who can't pick stocks, sports, or politics which is why no one ever seems to want to hear from him.....

No one is going to recall the guy who picks Obama by 10 electorals if it turns out to be 150 margin.  Believe me.
It might dawn on people scoffing about my call on the election, but i am basically taking the Over on Obama. Everyone else is too close
RT @FreeMrktCptlst: @jimcramer Watching you on @ESPN….nice--thanks!
If you said "the race is close" i could see that, if you say the electorals are close i just don't know how you get that at all.
All polls are focused on popular vote, which is a parlor game. It is the electorals that matter. That's the flaw..why don't people see that?
