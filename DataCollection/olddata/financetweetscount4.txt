Page:10*count:40-->Just checked with Zappos legal team and haven't received any communication (phone call, letter, email) from DSW, just press release. Weird.
Page:10*count:41-->Press release claims we were using DSW store photographs to mislead people. Obviously Zappos would never intentionally do that.
Page:10*count:42-->Weird, just found out through a PRESS RELEASE that DSW filed a lawsuit against Zappos. Maybe phone call, letter, or email more productive??
