@BobTonini Was three...Added two more since with new evidence. Still great old names.
@WordOnTheFarm Just checked his gamelog which verifies what you say. Not sure why he wouldn't come up under NYY SS postseason XBH search.
Upon further review the Yankee shortstop answer is actually six (or possibly 7, depending on source). Nobody mentioned the 6thyet.
@WordOnTheFarm Correct.
@WordOnTheFarm Stats Inc. disagrees. It's funny how many instances of disagreeing numbers I come across depending on the source.
@WordOnTheFarm my bad. Larry not Fred. Kudos (yet not the right answer. (Fred is a hint I guess)

@schaefersteve 2 for 3. Well done.
@WordOnTheFarm 2 for 3 and thank you for the Fred Milbourne reference on @sinow. Has to be a first. Bravo.
@freehan11 No but they were in the '64 Series.
@JohnBuford Yes, but that Fenway HR was a regular season game. (no. 163)
@BobTonini Nope.
@ScratchBabble 1 for 3
Since 1965 only five Yankee shortstops have extra base hits in the postseason. Obv. Jeter and now Nix are two. Who are the others?
@BobbyHicks_ Thanks!
367 days ago Ben Roethlisberger threw 5 TD passes against the Titans in a 38-17 Steelers win. 2 went to Hines Ward—his final NFL TDs.
Chris Johnson's career-high in yards from scrimmage against Steelers is 70, and that came in '08. He's never had >70 rush yds. vs. Pit.
Jayson Werth's last walkoff home run came for the Phillies against the Nationals on 9/19/10. The victim? Drew Storen, today's winner.
Steelers at Titans also coming up. Troy Polamalu and LaMarr Woodley among PIT inactives. Jake Locker sits for TEN.
Joe Saunders has pitched 189 regular season big league games, 122 in the AL but just 1 in the Bronx. This is 6th playoff game. 3rd in Bronx.

RG3's first NFL TD pass was for 88-yards. Kirk Cousins' was for ONLY 77-yards. #Redskins
His numbers (9-65-1) aren't gaudy but Julio Jones is having himself an excellent game after only one catch last week.
Kirk Cousins in for an injured RG3. #Redskins
@lbohmnation It was a fumbled snap. They never had a chance.
Awful fumble at the goalline for Matt Cassel. #Ravens ball.  Paging Brady Quinn. Your offense is waiting.
@o6whiteboy Had the yardage but only 2 TDs.
Browns basically hand Giants 3 points on pass interference call at end of 1st half. NYG 27, CLE 17 Halftime.
Tony Gonzalez catches his 99th career TD pass.Tied Don Hutson for 8th place alltime. One more ties 6th place w/ Tim Brown, Steve Largent
Randall Cobb looked like he was running track on that play. Great route, great throw. TD #Packers.
A's take a 2-1 lead on Pennington single. Detroit Mid 7.
Insane one-handed grab by Reggie Wayne from Andrew Luck while being interfered with by Charles Woodson.
Don't look now but Jamaal Charles has his sights set on another 200-yard rushing game.  in the second quarter he has 106 on 18 carries.
Michael Vick has lost 7 fumbles this season. In 20 career games another running QB, Cam Newton,  has lost a total of 9.
Cedric Benson gets them there and John Kuhn punches it in. TD #Packers.
Can't anyone around here hold onto the ball? Fumbles all around the NFL right now. Even in the dry games.
Through three innings, Tigers 1, A's 1.
That TD run up the middle was all too easy for Trent Richardson.
Grreat throw by Avisail Garcia to cut down Coco Crisp at the plate. Oakland 1, Detroit 0. T3.
Getting ready for kickoff. Good luck to all of you fantasy football players.
The 5 rookie RBs since '60w/ 375 yards and 4 TD by Week 4 are LaDainian Tomlinson, Earl Campbell, Eric Dickerson, Billy Sims, Alfred Morris.
@TMM75 Correct.
Hint: One of the five (since 1960) is current.
@SLAB783 I don't like it much but FJax.

Chipper reaches on an infield single and Freeman hits a ground-rule double with two outs. The Braves will not go down quietly.
Jason Motte with a HUGE strikeout of Michael Bourne with the bases loaded. On to the 9th, 6-3 #Cardinals.

Send your fantasy Qs to @SI_DavidSabino all week and come back here for more live NFL tweeting all day Sunday. Have a good night.
Bad news, Kolb fumbles on sack. Good news: He won't get sacked again as Rams kill the clock.
@SherryesKitchen @Burns620 Offensive Line – Carl Mauck
Now we see why Peyton Manning never really considered the Cardinals a viable option.
Kolb the 2nd ARI QB to go down 16x in back-to-back weeks. Jake Plummer was sacked 8x each 11/9 and 11/16/97. Then 10x two weeks later.
I'd have to say that we're due for an exciting Thursday night game one of these weeks.
@Forebogey @SI_DavidSabino Sure, depending on what you can get.
Rams are up 14 and looking to go 3-0 at home and 2-0 in the division.
Chris Givens gets behind the defense and Bradford hits him for a 52-yard score.

One thing's for sure, nobody's fantasy team is being helped much so far tonight.
USC cuts the Utah lead to 14-10 with a  32 yard Andre Heidari field goal.

You have spoken and Ed Reed gets the nod as the NFL's most exciting defensive back. Hard to argue against.  #TheU #Ravens
Jinx alert: This game is flying by.
35-yard field goal by Feely ends a 17-play 63-yard drive and makes it Rams 7, Cards  3. That's right, 17 plays to go 63 yards.
@jparf We tweet live during the NFL on Thursdays and all day Sundays. Have all season thus far.
That was the first time the Rams opening score of a game was a TD. All four others were field goals.
TD Bradford to Kendricks.
@treider1 It was a quite exciting play. Ha!
And that's why Danny Amendola is among the league leaders in catches. Great one-armed grab.
Is Patrick Peterson the most exciting defensive back in the NFL? If not, who is?

@chriscrawford24 that's it.
@SpencerFarrin Blast from the past...good one but no.

RT @adamdyson: @aroundthehorn kind of pathetic that I know for a fact you're actually saying it n BW Voice as u type it,then laughing to ...
*Still Barry White Voice* But tomorrow I'm gonna do things w/ joysticks & buttons. Bad things. A First Mute, A Last Mute, an Everything Mute
*Barry White Voice*  Hey baby, I know I've been gone for a long, long time. I know you can't hardly remember when I last was Around....
@DONALLOGUE Cool runnings with you today. You're a righteous dude.  If you ever need an overgelled winger for Hollywood Utd, give a holler.
.@teebalicious I was on receiving end of a filthy backheeler from @alexmorgan13 Over my head/gathered/scored in my face. Still dizzy.
@FireRunner Send any photos you have of the game over and I'll post them.
@cardo_dav I am in awe of Pep.  The man has won 6 titles in the last year.  And he has a great tan.
Kobe has game. Learned it from the paisans growing up in The Boot. Finished as winning Keeper. My gloryhound shot in last tick went 3rd row
Kobe didn't have an answer for my crossed armed defensive, er, stance RT @craigstouffer @AroundTheHorn & Kobe Bryant  http://t.co/ZYifvJD

@unc00 heard it.  Decided it wasn't worth spinning out the segment for a mis-speak.  The ruling stands!
.@c0howda I asked for a winner, not for a guy who could be T19 on Friday.  How bout this-If Sergio wins @TimCowlishaw can host PTI Monday
Enough to give a better headsup. I commit to being better at that, starting now- ESPN2 TOMORROW RT @Beleynn How much notice u get for ESPN2?

If you've got the itch, Bill, Woody, Tim and Jackie are ready to scratch it.  Horn.  ESPN.  Now.

@bomani_jones Ha. You've seen me in public. You know my game is far below the league minimum.

@bleedtheblock Thanks for remembering, Savannah.  Have a great 4th.  And keep all fireworks away from your hair.
@bobbyp8183 I think you got 4 differing opinions - on two opposite sides of the story - in the show today.
@bobbyp8183 to me it's this: Either buy, or don't buy, Vick's sneakers.  Anything more than that- saying he can/can't- not for me
@bobbyp8183 Wouldn't call that ignorance. To me that's people wanting to believe in redemptive qualities.
@bobbyp8183 No one's wrong. That's the point. The only wrong was the original act Vick committed. And according to the gov he paid his price
@bobbyp8183 Understand that feeling, but can't subscribe to it. Don't want to believe anyone is defined by any 1 thing they did.
@bobbyp8183 Gotcha. I don't believe anyone is scum of earth. I believe in paying for mistakes, doing penance for sins, and 2nd chances
@bobbyp8183 Whaddaya mean, Bobby?
It's about to get good looking up in here. Plaschke! Paige! Blackistone! Smith!  Please form an orderly cue interested people.  Horn!

1 blowout came after game was tied mid 2nd & there was an illegal hit.  Another blowout came after Luongo pumped his own tires & got yanked.
Just because final score wasn't close doesnt mean uncompelling. RT @DavidAlen Just because it went 7 doesn't mean good. 4 Blowouts
Game 1 decided with 18 seconds left... Game 2 decided 11 seconds into OT... Biting... Big Hits... Pumped tires... Flat tires... 7 games...
I can't believe this to be true. Is it? RT @erikritland Let JA know there are many who agree that the Stanley Cup Finals weren't compelling

Absolutely, friendo.  You know what to do, just bust a mute.   RT @agruber6 Didn't Plaschke say this series was over after game 1?
This.  Series.     And it appears there will be another opportunity for Woody to say "something's a Bruin." Everyone wins.
Filthy wrister > pumped up tires.
I'll bet Sean is having a tough day at school. Everyone all like: "Call me when LeBron gets 5 rings" & "It's the ONLY ARGUMENT I NEED SEAN!"
The mute button: it's so choice.  If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.
Alright, here we go.  And then there was one.  I have no idea how this is going to work out.
Paige & Stone have some work to do if they want to make it into Showdown.  Have to get out of Negs or it's Jackie by herself in Showdown.
Dikemebe Mute-ombo!  (via @b3rtaxxx)

What has 4 mouths, 12(ish) topics, 1 winner & an inestimable number of mutes? Horn. ESPN. Now.
Teams that win Gm 5 of Finals win series 73% of time. Surprisingly low. That's the 2-3-2 talking. Team with final 2 at home still with life.
If there ever were a time for the Sam Cassell 'I've got cantaloupes' dance, it was after Jason Terry's last 3. But the Jet took precedence.
Normally the resuscitation of an exhumed corpse would be the 1 storyline.  In this series, Jason Kidd is like story #8.
RT @bruce_arthur  LeBron seems to be trying to play the game he needs to play, rather than the one people want him to play.
@oznogrd good? 3 pts 1 asst 22% FG this postseason. He's failful.  wore 10 his whole career until last 2 months. Once he went 0 he went bad
Just so we're clear here: calling Clint Hurdle a tanager is the highest compliment I can imagine.

Shocking fact from Plachke, via Canzano's column: Only team in West that hasn't won a playoff series in last 10 years? Portland.
Mid-commercial Word Game!   Bob Ryan just ____ Carlos Boozer in that discussion.

@jkirbyanderson that's a great Q, Josh.  I'll ask the panel.
And the most jaw dropping thing - in one week LeBron will go from guarding an MVP PG to a 7 foot PF who hasn't missed in a month.

First born will definitely be either Fiorello LaGuardia Reali Or Fiorella LaGuardia Reali. Ella. Ella. Ella. Eh. Eh.
Truer story: We momentarily lost that ring -again!- one month later when our house burned down. But that's a story for another 15 tweets.
Janitor was buffing the floor next to us & looked over thinking 'this is romantic?!?!' ... But in end, wouldn't have it any other way.
Rip the ring out, take Stat Girl by hand, get down on my knee, & propose in between the Men's and Women's bathroom at LaGuardia. #TrueStory
Bag mistakenly given to another couple & they called at curbside checkin. Taxi to airport, see bag, rip open bag, see box, rip open box...
I go outside & get ready for Projectile Vomit mode. After 10 more minutes Mgr tells me bag has been located. It's at Laguardia Airport...
Hotel has no clue where bag is, I tell them (discreetly so Stat Girl wouldn't hear) that engagement ring was in bag.  Manager cries
So here's the whole Engagement story: Ring, in a box, in my shoe, in a bag, in the safe at Hotel. They lost it. Couldn't locate for halfhour

Wow. @ESPN_Colin just sat in on our daily production meeting, and it lasted 3 times as long! Sheesh...Red Bull anyone?
Watched an old 'Modern Family' earlier. And @marcelluswiley, you are just plain wrong about Sophia Vergara. She is perfection in human form.
Come on, boys...even rocket scientists grasp sarcasm, right? :-) @gschandler and @lwdupont
I stand before you, tweeting: @notthefakeSVP is NOT a diva. He just prefers 6 pieces of ice in his soda. And needs a solo room to meditate.

Ditto. Nighty night, tweeps. RT @JimNorton: I know it's time for bed because my belly button stinks. Goodnight.
Saddest part about all of this is the name-calling pathetic bandwagon-jumping Heat fans. Run to Champs, little ones. Get your jerseys.

My takeaway from Royal Wedding: beautiful young couple..after hour 11, they must have been wishing they could have eloped. TOO MUCH!!!
