http://twitpic.com/1m1g - My bald head with a Zappos tattoo on top for our annual Bald & Blue day at Zappos HQ.
Getting my head shaved right now in front of our offices for annual Zappos Bald & Blue day with @zappos_alfred while twittering.
Every year # of employees participating grows, sometimes women shave too. We will be posting pictures at http://blogs.zappos.com after!
Zappos annual Bald & Blue event is today. Employees will be shaving each other's heads and spraypainting heads blue. I will be bald soon.
Back in Vegas. Finished half box of triscuits, slept entire way. Feel much better now, just really worn out. Thx all for the well wishes.
Food poisoning, had chills, throwing up every hour, almost  did in meeting. @zappos_fred driving us back to Vegas. Lying down in back seat.
Just did interview w/  @marklennon explaining why twitter is special. The challenge of expression in 140 chars makes twitter the new haiku.
@kevinrose how long are you in Vegas for?
Will be at shade hotel bar with @zappos_fred until at least 10 PM. Meeting up with Matt from Zappos.TV. Stop by if you are in the area!
Skechers president impressed by twitter, gave away first 9 pairs of shoes in Manhattan Beach store in 30 minutes. He is going to sign up!
http://twitpic.com/1jzo - Managed to convince Skechers president to let me take picture with bunny ears :)
Skechers president says first 10 people to show up in Manhattan Beach Skechers store before 830 PM and say "zappos" get 1 pair of free.
Skechers president wants to test out the power of twitter. So he is giving away 10 free pairs of Skechers. Details in next twitter.
Trying to convince Skechers president to join twitter. He wants to know if there are any Skechers fans out there. Twitter @zappos replies!
At bar at Shade Hotel in Manhattan Beach waiting for Skechers CEO. Rooms in hotel are cool, really like desk that rolls & hovers over bed.
Finished lunch at Baja Fresh in Barstow. Sad that Twitter is not delivering all my @ messages to my phone. :( I hope Twitter gets well soon.
Driving to LA with @zappos_fred. Dinner with Skechers CEO tonight, then meeting tomorrow, then back to Vegas.
Just finished watching video of David Hansson (37signals, Ruby on Rails). Pretty entertaining, mentions Zappos! http://tinyurl.com/46ft6s
Just finished a long meeting that lasted 7 hours... Went through 7 cans of red bull and 7 slim jims today -- That's a new record for me! :)
About to do a conference call. Way too early to be awake,  couldn't find another time to do it. Getting out of bed was not easy. Red Bull!
Taking a break from emails all day to watch Indiana Jones 4. One of my jobs in high school was game tester for Indiana Jones 3 video game.
Found out that friend @gregnyc got hit by car while riding bike, in hospital. Going through surgery tomorrow. Reminds me life is precious.
At bbq at @zappos_keith house. Weather is cooperating. I used to live in this house, so kind of weird being back, brings back good memories.
Thx everyone for great feedback on new Zappos site! Web team is reading all, please keep it coming! View feedback: http://twitter.zappos.com
We've made lots of improvements to our new beta site - http://zeta.zappos.com - would love feedback via twitter & orange box (top right)!
Good meeting with fitfuel.com and headsets.com CEOs. Wandering around Mandalay Bay garage trying to remember where I parked.
fitfuel.com CEO & headsets.com CEO at Mandalay Bay. Both are very customer focused, it's great to get customer service companies together!
Just landed in Vegas. Headed to Mandalay Bay to meet founder & CEO of Headsets.com. We used to be neighbors in San Francisco!
Just finished board meeting, headed to airport to fly back to Vegas. It's been a long day!
Headed to Sequoia HQ on Sand Hill for board meeting. Big backlog of twitter msgs and emails to respond to, hope to catch up over the weekend
At Zingari in Union Square in SF with Zappos folks for pre-board meeting dinner. Board meeting tomorrow at Sequoia HQ on Sand Hill.

Sorry Bill Gates if I weirded you out w/ bunny ears photo at Microsoft. Headed to Seattle airport to fly to SF for tomorrow's board meeting.
I think Bill Gates was kind of weirded out by request but he was cool about it and agreed. Not sure if photo turned out though, more later.
Just had photo w/ Bill Gates & bunch of CEOs. Afterwards asked him for photo w/ me doing rabbit ears behind him (per twitter suggestion).
Bill Gates speaking at conference - On Microsoft being behind Google on search: "It's kind of fun to be an underdog... It's neat."
Bill Gates speaking now at Microsoft advertising conference, giving presentation... I am in back row, sitting next to CEO of Overstock.com
On way to Microsoft w/ @zappos_fred Looked at agenda, apparently I am supposed to be in photo w/ Bill Gates. I wonder if I can Twitpic Bill.
Thx @kristen_ @yqiang @scarab5 for last minute drinks w/ @zappos_fred and me! It was fun! Bedtime now, early morning tomorrow w/ Bill Gates
Ok @zappos_fred & I are going to buy drinks 4 anyone that shows up at BluWater in Kirkland, WA between now and 1130 PM. Tell hostess Zappos.
Re: Dahlia question, we were discussing w/ Microsoft whether should go there after dinner. We decided 2 say bye 2 msft.. Now in Kirkland, WA
Thanks to everyone who responded about Dahlia in Seattle query. Was trying to show Microsoft that Twitter is a pretty good search engine :)
Anyone know anything about Dahlia restaurant in Seattle? Worth going to?
At Microsoft pre-event dinner with @zappos_fred - no Bill Gates in sight but Patrick Byrne CEO of Overstock.com is here.
Just landed in Seattle. Press event w/ Bill Gates and Microsoft tomorrow re: search advertising. I wonder if Bill will talk to me this time?
Different TSA employee then places bowl with cell phone on top of my laptop, which leaves big circular mark on laptop that won't come off.
TSA again unapologetic, says not their problem, accuses me of placing bowl on top of laptop. I wish TSA was not a monopoly.
At Vegas airport, picked for extra screening. TSA drops my phone on floor, unapologetic, tells me I probably have dropped it more than them.
Wow lots of great feedback! Thx everyone, check out feedback at http://twitter.zappos.com esp if you are a Zappos employee on Twitter!
Problem is seems 2 freak people out & they think we are telling employees 2 do so but we're not. Tell employees 2 stop? @zappos advice pls.
Need advice: Zappos employees are very enthusiastic about Twitter, many follow people mentioning "Zappos" on http://twitter.zappos.com ...

Headed home. Wondering what's up with @el_gato and whether it is a he or she. Maybe it will tell me one day.
Thanks everyone 4 feedback on Wahoos! It helped convince Wing to join Twitter. Sent him link to tutorial: http://twitter.zappos.com/start
Wing Lam (founder of Wahoos Tacos) wants to know what people think of Wahoos. Twitter @zappos with your feedback if you've eaten there, thx!
@markdavidson hey mark, I just want to let you know that I work for zappos.
Back in Vegas, it's hotter here than it was in Cabo. Headed to MGM to meet Wing Lam, founder of Wahoos Tacos, at Country Music Awards party.
Reading "Tribal Leadership", found via twitter. Good so far describes same thing we r trying 2 do: company culture & make world better place
http://twitpic.com/17ni - Bye bye Cabo. Thanks for the memories. Also thanks for the fun stuff we can't remember.
Enjoying last meal in Cabo. We decided to cut our trip short, too much to do this week. Plus I need to spend some quality time w/ @el_gato
In taxi on way to go jetskiing with @zappos_fred & @zappos_steve
Woke up confused this morning on top of bed covers still in my jeans. Vaguely remember thinking "I'll just close my eyes for a minute..."
Also makes body shots easier. Add Vitamin B to mix, make organic, healthiest combo ever. @diy_eleen makes lip balm, will ask her 2 research
Add sunscreen, lip balm, and alcohol to the combo so 6-in-1. Hang out at beach or take a shot of 6in1 at party if bored. Never get sunburnt.
Survey: would you buy 3 oz bottle that was 3 in 1 combo of toothpaste, shaving cream & lotion for travel? Lotion smell but toothpaste taste.
Idea: Save best twitter msgs, put them randomly inside fortune cookies (perfect msg length). Serve in Chinese restaurants, entertain diners
Twitter improves lives: Normally bad situations (balcony lockout, lost wedding ring) make good twitter stories & rest of world entertained.
Typo tweet from @zappos_alfred: "Anyone w/ a mental detector met us at the Office in Cabo. I will buy dinner and drinks." He is distracted.
Dinner on beach @zappos_alfred drops wedding ring. 8 people, 20 mins digging thru sand, no ring. Can't contact wife, twitters, needs Patron.
We had a patron silver shot. I have a feeling @zappos_alfred will need another one very very soon. Wait for his twitter update to learn why.
http://twitpic.com/16s4 <- At "The Office" restaurant on the beach in Cabo. Wish I had an office like this.
Spent all day in hotel room,  email catch up. Avoided balcony. Headed 2 downtown Cabo now 4 "The Office" restaurant recommended via twitter!
Zappos now sells Nintendo, Playstation, XBOX, and digital cameras:
