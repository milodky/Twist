DPI is the bane of the fantasy owners existence. Lloyd misses a TD on interference. Ridley closes it out.

@btaylor1978 Miami gives up a ton through the air. I'd give Britt the edge although not shying away from Greene this week.
@wilkentj Giants: Bennett, Cruz, Nicks should be back to normal at Cincinnati.
@HoganMike Have to play the Bears. Dominant fantasy defense should be matchup-proof.
@montysu Wonderful problem. I'd have to use Ryan. Try to trade one for a big RB/WR if you can.
@chris_campagna Lloyd and Leshoure.
@HeatherrGlass Patriots. They'll get some takeaways v. Buffalo.
@npuccine Time for Hail Mary trades/moves and start planning for next year.
@bugler54 Minnesota. Detroit is more mistake prone.
@hollywoodheffne Reece. Daniels is a gametime decision and you can't risk him not playing.
@HeatherrGlass Eli has the better matchup and responds well to the pressure of last two week's struggles. Texans could neutralize Cutler

#RL Jets RB Bilal Powell has a concussion. He's out for the rest of the game.
#RL WR Golden Tate to WR Sidney Rice, 23-yd TD. 1st TD pass thrown by opposing receiver since TE Ken Dilger to Marvin Harrison @ IND in '01.
#RL Tim Tebow's having his most offensive involvement as a Jet in this game: 4 rushes, 14 yds, 3-for-3 passing for 8 yds.
#RL Bryan Thomas, David Harris split a sack of Russell Wilson. It's Jets' 4th sack this game, equaling season high (vs. Andrew Luck, IND).
@jennyrose322 We're confident we can take care of business here in Seattle today, Jenn. #LetsGoJets
#RL Jets defense pitches its 4th 3-and-out drive of the game on SEA's first series of 2nd half.
#RL Seahawks lead 14-7 at halftime and also lead in yards (134-112), 1st downs (8-5), possession (15:25-14:35). Teams tied in turnovers 2-2.
@artpilz We'll be looking to hold them here, Arturo. #LetsGoJets
#EA B. Powell slow to get up after that punt.  SEA has ball at their 43 with 1:19 on the clock.
#EA Call upheld.   Jets now trail 14-7.  2-Minute warning.  'Hawks will get the ball to start the 3rd.  Jets have 2 TOs and ball at own 21.
#RL Seattle leads 14-7. The 'Hawks' 7-point lead is their largest first-half lead over the Jets at home since 1979, a span of 6 games.
#EA Seattle takes the 13-7 lead as they capitalize after the turnover.  Lynch got in from 1-yard out.  They are reviewing the play though.
#RL Antonio Cromartie, who leads Jets in INTs (3), pass defenses (10), gets a big PD in end zone on Wilson fleaflicker pass to Sidney Rice.
#EA Now we're even in the turnover department as Jeremy Kerley can't field the punt.  SEA ball at the NYJ 42.
#RL Jets third 3-and-out series this game. Robert Malone's nifty drop punt forces Leon Washington to fair-catch it at SEA-10.
#EA Jets D in 1.5 quarters: 3 sacks, 2 takeaways, 1 TD.
#RL Ellis Lankster strip-sack of Russell Wilson was Lankster's first career sack. Jets have ball at midfield.
@JoshieichibaN That was a big stop, Josh. #LetsGoJets
#EA Wilson is rattled.  Lankster comes untouched and gets the strip-sack. Ricky Sapp almost had it, but the 'Hawks recovered.
@AliciaLavancox3 We appreciate all of the love, Alicia. #LetsGoJets
#RL Mark Sanchez tries to find Dustin Keller in EZ, throws his 4th red zone INT this season to CB Richard Sherman, who steps OB at SEA-2.
#EA Jets breaking tendencies today.  They go back-to-back with 15 carries to get the 1st and now are in business after 6 goes to 11 for 43.
#RL Jeremy Kerley's 43-yd completion from Mark Sanchez to SEA-7 gives JK 4 catches for 55 yds today.
#EA That's Pace's 1 Fumble Recovery of the season and 10th of his career.
#RL Mo Wilkerson forces Marshawn Lynch FUM, Calvin Pace recovers. Seahawks have as many giveaways in this game (2) as in first 4 home games.
@BigShaq18 We appreciate the support, Shaquille. #LetsGoJets
#EA Fumble recovery by the Jets.  They got the ball out from Lynch.  That's 2 takeaways now.  Looks like C. Pace has it.
#RL Jets CB Isaiah Trufant has a knee injury. His return to this game is questionable.
#EA 7-7 at CenturyLink Field. 1st career TD for Mo Wilkerson.  That was Bart's first sack of the year on the last series.
#RL Mo Wilkerson 21-yd FUM-return TD off Mike DeVito stripsack ties it at 7. Jets' first defensive FR TD since Marques Douglas @ IND in 09.
#EA That's Wilson's 1st home turnover this year.  Mike Devito with the strip-sack and Wilkerson rumbles in from 21 yards out. We got a tie!
#RL Bart Scott gets his 1st sack since Game 14 @ PHI last year, taking down Wilson for 12-yd loss. ...
#EA TD Big Mo Wilkerson!
#RL RB Bilal Powell's first touch in 3 games goes for 7 yards on a second-down draw.
@JacquelynSpader Our game is being televised on CBS, Jackie. Check your local listings for details.
#EA Jets are going to continue to try to knock that ball loose from Marshawn Lynch.  Lankster got in there with some pressure on 3rd down.
#RL Leon Washington's first touch vs. his former team is a 20-yd punt return to SEA 40.
#RL Before that TD, Jets had scored first in 8 of the previous 9 games vs. Seahawks (7-2), and in the previous 5 games @ SEA (3-2)
@tfallo22 We can't hear that enough, Tara. #LetsGoJets
#RL Russell Wilson to WR Golden Tate for 38-yd TD over Kyle Wilson. SEA rookie has 10 TD passes (0 INTs) in 5 games at CenturyLink Field.
@RachelBarese Way to represent the #GreenAndWhite, Rachel.

@MrRatch That's right, Adam. #LetsGoJets
#RL Tim Tebow pass to Jeremy Kerley for 1 yard. Tebow now 3-for-4 passing on the season.

@mschub0928 Jay was featured in many of the videos we included in the show, also in the Sgt Peppers photo & I mentioned him by name in wrap
Assassin's Creed III looks berserker.  1 question: Whose side is that enormous bear on?
@dan_fink Happy is one of my fave songs. On the doc Ladies and Gentlemen, where's the cam when Keef is singing? On Mick shaking his bony bum
@AmyKNelson Seriously-what kind of chills do you get when she sings? I just summited Everest while only wearing a windbreaker, chills.
@GinaNYactress Tweeted that last week. Or, thought I did, My parents, aunts, uncles, cousins made out ok. You?
@dan_fink @officialKeef Agree completely. I was a Mick guy once. Once.  That book changed everything for me.
OK- last tweet on this, promise: Mick & Merry Iso Tracks on Gimme Shelter. At 3:03 Merry makes the Earth spin off axis http://t.co/bjkic9to
Merry Clayton is the female voice on the Stones' version of Shelter. (Those iso tracks are a revelation).  Her own vision melts faces.
Well done, RT @mbeidoun99 and @D_Rooney6
Merry Clayton. Made the photo because I've listened to her version of Gimme Shelter every day for the past year. Here: http://t.co/tLEjoY0T

@awfulannouncing Thank you very much for the kind words.
Apparently my phone just spit out some tweets I sent out last week. Or thought I sent out last week. (TIMING!) Let's all proceed as normal.

So tired of the "elite" QB conversation...who cares?! If you win you're elite...if you don't you're not...it's real simple.
Two best referees when I was playing were Red Cashion & Jerry Markbreit...appreciated the way they controlled a game & respected the players
Referee Gene Steratore has always been a referee in command...I've respectfully referred to him as "The Sheriff"...he's one of the best.
NFL has prioritized getting tough on labor over integrity of game but Commissioner is simply a broker for owners http://t.co/fYP4ppee

Romo wins it for the Giants! That sentence has two meanings today.
Somewhere in Dallas, Tony Romo just threw another interception.
Peyton Manning, still awesome.
Just like we've been saying all day, Tony Romo is the MOST CLUTCH QB IN THE LEAGUE.
Could not have written a more perfect ending than Tony Romo backpedaling 20 yards on 4th down and then throwing an interception.
Only takeaway from the Raiders-Chiefs game: Matt Barkley should start looking into real estate in the Kansas City area.

Tony Romo just needs to do something real quick before he runs to the locker room... http://t.co/L6yYFUv9
