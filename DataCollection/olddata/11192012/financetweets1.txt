@VaVaVirtual A mix is best. You get into a groove with LinkedIn and instincts take over.  #smallbizpgh
@DevCleary Great to have you joining us tonight. I appreciate it. #smallbizpgh
@bearclawjackson Start by learning how to use social media properly and build your foundation. Slow & steady wins the race. #smallbizpgh
@bearclawjackson It's never too early to learn about social media for biz. Find internships, connect w/ potential employers. #smallbizpgh
A8c: Find out info about prospects on LinkedIn...common interests & connections. You can also get info on competitors. #smallbizpgh
A8b: Selling is 90% preparation/10% presentation. LinkedIn is a big help getting you to the 90% mark. #smallbizpgh
Q8: LinkedIn is a incredible tool for networking! You can join niche groups, ask questions, give answers.  #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz Happy birthday!! #smallbizpgh
If you know a small biz owner who could use advice tell them to follow #SmallBizPgh and join us every month 7 – 8pm.    #smallbizpgh
A7b: A good mix includes events (be a panelist/speaker if you can) + online discussions (Twitter/LinkedIn).     #smallbizpgh
@MamaBritt Well deserved.
A7: Consistency is the name of the game. Effective networking takes time. Don’t force the conversation & be genuine.     #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: Every experience & failure teaches lessons. Pay attn to the lessons. You will be more successful in biz. #smallbizpgh
@fleejack Great question for @lindahandleyinc. I always suggest local chapters of @SCOREMentors @ASBDC & @SBAgov  #smallbizpgh
@JodiOkun Ask a dealbreaking question upfront (it usually involves $ or expectations). If you don't get the right answer...run. #smallbizpgh
@DiversityWoman Partial list @rieva, @karenkerrigan, @barbaraweltman, @JodiOkun, @mamabritt, @lindahandleyinc, @marketingedge #smallbizpgh
@DiversityWoman I have a list of SMB experts on my Twitter page. Lots of smart, sharp women thought leaders there. #smallbizpgh
@RupiPANAICH It's about engagement. Put info on your FB page that customers/prospects want to see. Then invite them over ;) #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter Only partner with other people/companies if they help can you in achieving your goal. Otherwise, why bother? #smallbizpgh
RT @fleejack: here is an example of the #eyeme app @Abercrombie http://t.co/PVGRdWxg  How #smallbizpgh can make your own ads #smallbizpgh
RT @Rieva: @brianmoran Agreed. Participating in social media essential for small business. But be smart--go where your clients are
A6b: Partner with winners. People/companies that have a successful track record. Don't partner with a longshot. #smallbizpgh
A6: Partner w/ any person or biz that can help you reach your goal. Avoid wild goose chases & dead ends at all costs.  #smallbizpgh
RT @JodiOkun: Can I quote RT @rieva: @bridges4biz @brianmoran There are a lot of traits. Persistent. Optimistic. And ready to capitalize ...
@Rieva @bridges4biz now add #smallbizpgh so everyone can read that. Excellent point.
@HowardLewinter Like Dr. Seuss once said "sometimes the questions are complicated & the answers are easy." #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: Ask yourself: How does your competition use the internet and social media? #smallbizpgh
A5b: the rule with any #smallbiz is "when in doubt, ask." If you're not sure about customers using SM, ask them. #smallbizpgh
A5: It depends on the #smallbiz. Start by asking current clients LOTS of questions on how they use the Internet for business.  #smallbizpgh
@fleejack And that doesn't include my family! #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter It's as if you come to a party bearing gifts... #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: If you participate in social media and you provide relevant content there will be customers who find you. #smallbizpgh
A4c: Go to where the chats are taking place. If you go to a SM site & no one in your business is using it…leave! #smallbizpgh
A4b: Once you find your potential customers, see if industry experts use the same site. What about competitors? #smallbizpgh
A4: Ask them what SM tools they use for biz. Also ask current customers. Then, learn how to engage w/ them on those sites. #smallbizpgh
@fleejack First find one expert whom you trust, then ask them who they "follow." Also check LinkedIn for recommendations. #smallbizpgh
A3c: A good #entrepreneur is someone who absolutely loves what they do. That love is what carries them through the bad times. #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter All the NY Giants fans just "groaned." #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A3b: Someone who knows the bitter taste of defeat & works like hell never to taste it again. #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A3: By “good” I assume you mean successful. It’s someone who understands the risks and plans accordingly.  #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter Great point Howard. #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: After social media, how about some old fashioned selling? Contact your potential buyer & present yourself. #smallbizpgh
Good questions so far... #smallbizpgh
A2c: Check out industry/community sites. Network w/ like-minded #smallbiz. What marketing works for them? Fewer mistakes 4 you! #smallbizpgh
A2b: Find out which SM Tools your customers/prospects are using. No sense in building a FB page if no one visits it. #smallbizpgh
@gouterbridge Thanks Glen. Every #smallbiz should be checking out #eyeme. It's next generation of social media! #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A2: Social Media! Your biggest investment is time. Your customers & potential customers are online. Go find them. #smallbizpgh
@briantippens Thanks B. Hope you are well. #smallbizpgh
A1c: Many #smallbiz think social media is a fad & it won’t help their biz. It’s a “means to an end;” Get in the game. #smallbizpgh
A1b: No “real” biz plan. #Sandy is a stark reminder that #smallbiz WILL be interrupted. Have a plan “A” and plan “B.” #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A1: Cash Flow! Too many #smallbiz owners don’t have enough of a safety net to protect them when A/R goes net 90+ #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter Great to see you here Howard. #smallbizpgh
@fleejack Social Media could be as important as oxygen or water to some #smallbiz. It's the way we do biz now. #smallbizpgh

Tough day to make a stand... Too much gloom, not enough data....
@MattBaade If i am a bad stock picker how in heck did I beat the market almost every year and compound at 24% after all fees. What a mystery
To the BusinessInsider  folks who like my page generation, especially Joe W, my Boswell, I like being right more than being controversial
If i predicted a landslide for Romney, Business Insider would get 80,000 more pageviews and be ebitda positive that day
RT @SoDakLiberal:  The Romney people are just generally confused.-j if i predicted a landslide for Romney they would call me a genius.
If you ever say anyone might win, the other side decides you are against them. I think the Giants will win it all, but i hate them!!!
The Romney people seem confused--but the electorals aren't the same as the popular..
Jim Cramer is an idiot who can't pick stocks, sports, or politics which is why no one ever seems to want to hear from him.....
Memo to Business Insider: 1. i think i will be pretty close on the election. and 2. Joe, your corrosion and cynicism should be tempered
RT @Spear_Sue:  @jimcramer is obviously in need of publicity and I guess its working.. jj if only you knew how i really work !
#CountdownToKickoff gets it right every week.  Plus I am starting Fitz and Spiller so i feel the love!
RT @rocco_thestreet: .. Good work on @ESPN - Boomer loves you. jjc Boomer is gracious and brilliant! So is the whole ESPN gang
RT @rocco_thestreet: .Last night, I compared it to analyst estimates converging. Good call.- thanks for understanding my game, Rocco!!!!
Plus, one more thing, this election is like the stock market, everyone's long a close race. Everyone. So i have to take the other side!!!!
No one is going to recall the guy who picks Obama by 10 electorals if it turns out to be 150 margin.  Believe me.
It might dawn on people scoffing about my call on the election, but i am basically taking the Over on Obama. Everyone else is too close
RT @FreeMrktCptlst: @jimcramer Watching you on @ESPN….nice--thanks!
If you said "the race is close" i could see that, if you say the electorals are close i just don't know how you get that at all.
All polls are focused on popular vote, which is a parlor game. It is the electorals that matter. That's the flaw..why don't people see that?
@rocco_thestreet I have been called an idiot ever since i finished Magna  cum Laude at Harvard so it must be true, right? Uber idiot!!
RT @MyApplePi: I was checking out the Browns last week.  Think I saw  double bottom.  You see a trend reversal?-j  no- a head and shoulders
RT @MilesDaileader: @jimcramer is a idiot Jim Cramer: Obama Is Going To Obliterate Romney In Historic Landslide -jj and what if i am right?
@andrew_esposito getting many  "I hope your picks in stocks/sport are better than politics."  But people are now worrying if i am right!
