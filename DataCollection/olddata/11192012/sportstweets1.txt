@Jubetcha whereas the Lance story - the lawsuits, the witnesses, L'Equipe claims, USADA claims, Lance comments - has been around for years.
@Jubetcha 2) Our coverage of stories (and we don't report, we debate) is directly affected by many things-Tiger's story came out of no where
@Jubetcha Can only speak for our show. Here's my thinking: 1) comparative story analysis doesn't work because they aren't same story...

@BrianGardner_  I don't know what that means.
Well @BillPlaschke already better than your prediction of Old Dominion  makingh the Final Four #PlaschkePredictsNoNo
Nervous, @billplaschke?  +500 if Verlander throws the no-hitter like you predicted.
@FrostyFreeds When is it? I had one of my best games vs. Stony Brook in 99 (& didn't leave the field crying). Also nearly died on drive over
.@BillPlaschke So +500 if Verlander throws a no-no, like you predicted. But in the rare, unforeseen, chance he doesn't throw a no-no, what?

@bomani_jones hehe-I was just saying I was flummoxed. & I joined convo late, didn't see original pt.. I'm going back to prepping Mute Button
@tigerwilhite I read same stuff. But Gehrig winning Triple Crown & finishing 5th in voting raises questions to, right?
@bomani_jones Plus, Gehrig won Triple Crown in '34 & finished FIFTH in MVP! Lou Gehrig! Who hated him? So, I'm not all in with Ted hate.
.@bomani_jones and they did vote for him the 2 other years he won MVP. Did they "hate" him less then?
.@bomani_jones always been flummoxed by that. Media "hated" Ted-didn't win MVP either TripleCrown yr-but they did vote him 2nd those years
Lehrer could save this with an on target Paper Toss
I haven't heard "Look at the Schedule" or one Goodfellas reference yet. Are we sure this is a debate?
If Lehrer's not going to mute there at least better be a Fortune Teller or Good Cop / Bad Cop segment coming up. #PTItheDebate

@Shit_shoveler Gehrig won the Triple Crown in 34 and was 5th in MVP voting. And history tells us people loved Lou.
@Dan_McCarthy92 And Gehrig in 34? Won Triple Crown and finished 5th in MVP.  Even if you're not buying Ted, you gotta buy Lou!
@picabyte Time didn't permitt me to also mention Lou Gehrig's Triple Crown season not winning MVP. So even if you're not buying Ted, buy Lou
@picabyte I'm not buying that, Cathy. He finished 2nd in voting both Triple Crown years & 1st in his two MVP seasons. People voted for him.
@Dan_McCarthy92 I'm not buying that. He finished 2nd in voting both Triple Crown years & 1st in his two MVP seasons. People voted for him.
@Shit_shoveler He finished 2nd each of those years.  And won the award twice, in other years. He was voted for, just not 1st.

@oiler3535 assurances don't make errors and omissions.  facts and

@emoneybaby and astronomy&astrology were one in the same until centuries after Copernicus when astronomy became a science, so no correction
@CalebBlount of course, they've been most impressive/fortunate/best of 4-0s, there's no debate there, so we didn't ask that Q.
@emoneybaby @PTI I'll play your game, hehe-you wanted me to say Copernicus wasn't 5000 yrs ago/wasn't astrologer. 5000 was an exaggeration
@CalebBlount Bottom line: The Q wasn't Who's Better:Falcons or Cardinals? It was, 'Who's more Fortunate to be 4-0?' If they stink, it's them
@CalebBlount that's true. and that's the argument to make. but the argument that was made didn't say that. and that's what i have to score.
@oiler3535 @PTI Way out of my jurisdiction here but I think there was no "astronomy" 500 years ago & "astrologer/astronomer" were 1 in same.
@jadande @CalebBlount Wouldn't 'given where the franchise has been' makes it more compelling of a story? Plus, each franchise=0 Super Bowls
@CalebBlount @jadande I didn't say they weren't posers. They are. We all are. I said to ignore what they've done was elitist.

Always enjoy Chicago & NYC. RT @Boston_Bred: What's your favorite city to visit and call a game?
Yes, wouldnt trade my UCLA days for anything. RT @JFields50: If you had to do it over would you say no to Jimmy Johnson in college?

Lots to consider re: Peyton decision...49ers looked to be best fit but don't know all the variables affecting decision & may never know.
Not anymore. RT @USANFL: @lizzylondon Your too nice Troy! That decision sucked! #Broncos have worst offense of those he considered.
Another team RT @imalovelyman: Where do u figure Tebow will fit in the Broncos' plans w Peyton taking his starting job? FB? RB? TE?
Would've loved to see him in the NFC but a good choice. RT @LizzyLondon: What do you think of Manning's decision?
Yes, grand opening for very first Wingstop SPORTS. RT @TheRantingDead: Is it true you're going to be in Brownsville TX tomorrow?
Absolutely, they were top 4 last year without him. RT @BrandonWingo1: do u rate Denver top3 in AFC now, with Peyton?
49ers would be a good fit. RT @WFlyge: Will #49ers sneak in a grab Manning?
Have filled needs w limited cap space. RT @JulianMckelvey: What do u think of cowboys free agent signings so far??
Finished "Unbroken" by Laura Hillenbrand...excellent! Louis Zamperini & countless other POW's are an inspiration for generations to come.

You're beautiful too : ) RT @IrmaWinthrop: @TroyAikman never retweets or answers my questions. Is it bc I don't look like @mariamenounos?

Lots of traffic on the 101 going to Candlestick...rain coming down pretty good too.
Saw Eddie Debartolo, Jr in the gym this am...will serve as 49ers honorary captain for coin toss...great 49er teams & players under his watch
Strong winds impact passing game most. RT @SevenwithaT: Why would it be a factor? Rain and strong wind is not exclusive to San Francisco.
Never a factor when I played there but could be tomorrow RT @MandMSportshow: How difficult were the winds in Candlestick?
You too?  RT @thespoiler28: I've been diagnosed with charasthma - so much charisma that it makes it hard to breathe, any advice?

Getting morning workout in before heading over to Lambeau
Great example of good coverage & Brees throwing away from defender & trusting his receiver would adjust to the throw.
You're kidding, right? RT @jeffreymartens: Didn't need xtra week. Fangio would've done just as good w no xtra ... http://t.co/bMgLjsLP
Vic Fangio has called an excellent game for 49ers defense...showing what an extra week to prepare can do for a team.
Those catches are required to win games in the postseason. RT @Reptilian13: That was a big time pass, tough catch ... http://t.co/nCy5lcGr
@stromile88 Thought is to get to a manageable 3rd down distance but can't become predictable calling a run on every 2nd & long either.
Yes, didn't take THAT many hits! Some epic battles against them. #muchrespect RT @KingG2k11: Remember playing the 49ers in the playoffs?
Nowhere to throw w that kind of protection is impressive coverage by 49ers secondary...giving a lot of different looks.
Good for him...I couldn't pull that combo off. RT @shelbykitchens: What do you think about Moose's shirt/tie combo?
3rd & 3 and Brees takes shot to endzone...that's a confident QB...perfect throw.
49ers not giving up any big throws down field. Brees completing high % of passes. Big play offenses can get frustrated if that continues.
Favorite weekend of the NFL season...can't wait for 49ers/Saints on @NFLONFOX...@daryljohnston on the call says field is best he's ever seen
Congratulations Captain. RT @Murph_clp: Can I get a RT from one of my Cowboys heroes, I was promoted to Captain in the Houston Fire Dept.
