Page:9*count:105-->"Sif gets in a whole lot of trouble." -@PancakeLady #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:106-->Sif is an action hero. Loki isn't. I don't use the talking to get to the fighting, I use the fighting to get to the talking.-Kathryn Immonen
Page:9*count:107-->"Having said that, my fervent hope is to follow the same spirit of adventure but there isn't a 23-issue arc  planned out." -Kathryn Immonen
Page:9*count:108-->"It would be disingenuous of me to say what Kieron did wasn't daunting. I loved his approach." -Kathryn Immonen #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:109-->"We were looking for a character with a cool point of view who could take us in a fun new direction." - @PancakeLady #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:110-->"Journey Into Mystery is a story about the Nine Realms and everything that takes place within them." - @PancakeLady #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:111-->"I see a similarity between Sif & Loki because neither of them can be Thor. This more effect on her then she'll admit."  - Kathryn Immonen
Page:9*count:112-->"Sif is not just a warrior. We've often seen her leading the charge, but I don't feel like we've ever seen her in charge." -Kathryn Immonen
Page:9*count:113-->"So much of their conflict is internalized because they don't have alter egos. They're almost more human because of that." - Kathryn Immonen
Page:9*count:114-->"What's most interesting to me about the Asgardians is the inevitability of them." - Kathryn Immonen #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:115-->"There will be familiar faces showing up, but none I think anybody would expect." - Kathryn Immonen #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:116-->"One of the  interesting things about Sif is that she's defined by absence." - Kathryn Immonen #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:117-->"For Sif, what she wants above all is to be a better warrior. How far would she go for that?" - Kathryn Immonen #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:118-->"Kathryn was at the top of my list as far as character as well as keeping things interesting and quirky." - Lauren Sankovitch #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:119-->Kathryn Immonen is participating in #MarvelNBT liveblog, the new writer of Journey Into Mystery beginning in November with issues #646!

Page:9*count:133-->"I didn't hire a woman to write Avengers I hired Kelly Sue...for the same reasons I've hired and will continue to hire writers"-Tom Brevoort
Page:9*count:134-->"I'm very interested in making sure women knowing that wanting to work in this industry is not peculiar." - @kellysue #MarvelNBT

Page:9*count:137-->"The voices in my head for Thor, Iron Man, Hulk and Cap are the movie voices..." - @kellysue #MarvelNBT

Page:9*count:139-->"I have ideas about why the individual members do what they do, and it's interesting to butt them up against one another..." -@kellysue
Page:9*count:140-->"If Cap or Thor are there, you can have Quasar or Machine Man. They may not be in the movies now, but wait til Avengers 9!" - Tom Brevoort
Page:9*count:141-->"I really like large casts. It's in some ways a more comfortable way for me to write. I like to rotate point of view." -@kellysue #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:142-->"I'm interested in new media ideas. ...How does the age of the Internet affect the Avengers' public persona?" - @kellysue #MarvelNBT
Page:9*count:143-->"...When I saw the movie, I managed to keep it together until Iron Man came onscreen and Back in Black blared." - Kelly Sue DeConnick
