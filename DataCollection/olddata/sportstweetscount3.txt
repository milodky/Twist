Page:7*count:79-->No Jimmy Graham, no problem. TD David Thomas for the Saints.
Page:7*count:80-->Joe Flacco is 4 of 15 for 32 yards and an interception in the first half.

Page:7*count:86-->Welcome back, Chris Johnson. Where have you been?
Page:7*count:87-->@JohnFraser31 @SI_DavidSabino That's what I would've done.

Page:7*count:112-->@puzzletrax Morris

Page:7*count:114-->@gbuentello Spiller.
Page:7*count:115-->@rcoyne324 @EricMackFantasy Freeman has a great matchup but Romo is better this week.
Page:7*count:116-->@themlsmith Thomas
Page:7*count:117-->@SharpHarp92 No. Stick with Gronk who should have more chances now that Hernandez is back.
Page:7*count:118-->@gbuentello Jackson
Page:7*count:119-->@SharpHarp92 for who?
Page:7*count:120-->@wilkentj Yes with Brown and Bradshaw ahead of Wilson for NYG.
Page:7*count:121-->@MJMager Vikes with Skelton at QB and no running game for AZ.
Page:7*count:122-->@bhayden21 Gotta sit Bryant and Wallace and look to make a trade ASAP.
Page:7*count:123-->@wilkentj With Forte good to go he's limited to short-yardage or mop up duty.
Page:7*count:124-->@RY4N_D4RCY Dallas' D will concentrate on Smith and CLE doesn't have the DBs to stop Luck. Take a chance on Avery.
Page:7*count:125-->@philipleone @SI_DavidSabino PPR, sure. Neither will remind anyone of LT2.
Page:7*count:126-->@B_R_West Both teams will pass a lot. Slightest edge to Ben because of strength of supporting cast.
Page:7*count:127-->@badams206 I'd sit SJax.
Page:7*count:128-->@_ARII3 Lloyd
Page:7*count:129-->@Pat_Noble Nicks.
Page:7*count:130-->@wilkentj Such a tough call but I'd go with Brady by a tiny bit.

Page:7*count:133-->@mgugs46 I'd keep him in there. Roethlisberger's grumblings plus Bengals secondary should = good game for Brown.
Page:7*count:134-->@TYinUTAH @SI_DavidSabino TY Hilton.
Page:7*count:135-->@deafjeffm I'd sit Ballard.
Page:7*count:136-->@BurgerisaKeeper @SI_DavidSabino Felix.
Page:7*count:137-->@damiansmith0812 Cook. Finley has fallen off badly of late.
Page:7*count:138-->@EricMason4 RG3 because of his running.
Page:7*count:139-->@mgugs46 Blount-Hardesty. Woodhead decent since Pats RBs are thin today and vs old team but I like the others better.
Page:7*count:140-->@LynnKupfer Martin/Ridley
Page:7*count:141-->@DS_213 Very hard to trust. I'd look elsewhere.
Page:7*count:142-->@nastaiger Felix
Page:7*count:143-->@parfornick Colston.
Page:7*count:144-->@Kastman4 Wright, Morris and Greene.
Page:7*count:145-->@paydawg @SI_DavidSabino Denver's off so Tamme's out. Maybe Keller makes an appearance on the stats sheet.
Page:7*count:146-->@coachruda I like Martin and Washington.
Page:7*count:147-->@philipleone @SI_DavidSabino I don't trust Dwyer. Has done nothing all year. Was healthy scratch last week. If PPR can use Peerman
Page:7*count:148-->@qbkilla76 RG3 based on running ability.
Page:7*count:149-->@bugler54 @SI_DavidSabino Kickers are a crapshoot but I'd go with Nugent.
Page:7*count:150-->@wilkentj Should have easier time this week not having to concentrate solely on pass-blocking
Page:7*count:151-->@SportsIsLife_23 He's been great but I'd have to sit Rudy.
Page:7*count:152-->@BarelyRegal Ben and Gordon.
Page:7*count:153-->@Mgodsey2011 Peerman coming off of great game and BJGE disappointing. It's a gamble but PPR gives Peerman the edge.
Page:7*count:154-->@dwmiller1412 Fitz and Cobb
Page:7*count:155-->@WillSmiththe2nd Yes. He's running well and the team is phasing out SJax.
Page:7*count:156-->@mgugs46 I like both Tanner and Blount this week better than Woodhead.
Page:7*count:157-->@AdamWeigle No reason he shouldn't. In light of Big Ben's recent comments I'd look for more deep shots for he and Wallace.
Page:7*count:158-->@WestonWilcoxon @SI_DavidSabino Yes. Leading the league in yards per carry.
Page:7*count:159-->@McBeth88 I'd sit Bush.
Page:7*count:160-->@Chest_Rockwell7 Good luck.
Page:7*count:161-->@KGsDADDY11 @SI_DavidSabino Gordon
Page:7*count:162-->@Zach_Anderson40 Bradshaw.
Page:7*count:163-->@MarkyMark2_0 @SI_DavidSabino I don't trust DHB yet. Ogletree ready to break out again. I like Gordon too but go with DAL
Page:7*count:164-->@bugler54 @SI_DavidSabino I'd sit Green
Page:7*count:165-->@trainwreck00 Such a tough call. I'd have to side with Romo based on the defenses but always risky.
Page:7*count:166-->@BurgerisaKeeper @SI_DavidSabino Felix
Page:7*count:167-->@Chest_Rockwell7 I prefer Moore.
Page:7*count:168-->@wuratm Williams is on a roll and I'd use him in a favorable matchup.
Page:7*count:169-->@philipleone @SI_DavidSabino @EricMackFantasy Batch and Allen.
Page:7*count:170-->@jmoralez714 @SI_DavidSabino Sorry. Fred.
Page:7*count:171-->@somoge17 Luck at home vs. Cleveland.
Page:7*count:172-->@SmeeginLegan Greene and Dalton.
Page:7*count:173-->@DS_213 Cobb's a solid play today.
Page:7*count:174-->@LeeBremer I'd use Brown who should get some touches when Bradshaw needs a breather.
Page:7*count:175-->@BornNbredSooner Gordon.
Page:7*count:176-->@sirsharkey Ballard and Dwyer have shown nothing. I'd use Bennett.
Page:7*count:177-->@drjem5 @SI_DavidSabino RG3 has answered every challenge so far and his running puts him a hair ahead.
Page:7*count:178-->@LynnKupfer I'd sit DeA and use Richardson and Tate.
Page:7*count:179-->@a_kowalsky @SI_DavidSabino The two Giants are the safest picks. The Redskins give up a lot of points.
Page:7*count:180-->@WestonWilcoxon @SI_DavidSabino CJ too streaky. I'd use Spiller.
Page:7*count:181-->@Boomerseven @SI_DavidSabino I'd sit Leshoure vs. the very tough Bears.
Page:7*count:182-->@wcf8089 Ridley is a solid play anyhow especially vs. Jets and with Bolden out.
Page:7*count:183-->@jmoralez714 @SI_DavidSabino I'd go with Jackson given those choices.
Page:7*count:184-->@a_kowalsky @SI_DavidSabino Solid depth there. I'd use Bradshaw.
Page:7*count:185-->@WillSmiththe2nd Depends on who's available.
Page:7*count:186-->@mgugs46 I like Hernandez and would sit Tate.
Page:7*count:187-->@TerrazasManny Yes. Bradshaw will start according to multiple reports.
Page:7*count:188-->@wilkentj Dez. Smith slumping pre-bye and Pokes DBs are tough.

Page:9*count:115-->@BrendanHecht Miami

Page:9*count:117-->@wilkentj Not high on him.
Page:9*count:118-->@BrendanHecht Eagles.
Page:9*count:119-->@BrendanHecht Yup. Great Miami-Florida State matchup today.
Page:9*count:120-->@wcf8089 I'd stick with Jordy.
