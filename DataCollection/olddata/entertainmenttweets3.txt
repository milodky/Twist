Check out the transcript of the latest #MarvelNBT liveblog! http://t.co/eheVXWsZ #readcomics
"Sif gets in a whole lot of trouble." -@PancakeLady #MarvelNBT
Sif is an action hero. Loki isn't. I don't use the talking to get to the fighting, I use the fighting to get to the talking.-Kathryn Immonen
"Having said that, my fervent hope is to follow the same spirit of adventure but there isn't a 23-issue arc  planned out." -Kathryn Immonen
"It would be disingenuous of me to say what Kieron did wasn't daunting. I loved his approach." -Kathryn Immonen #MarvelNBT
"We were looking for a character with a cool point of view who could take us in a fun new direction." - @PancakeLady #MarvelNBT
"Journey Into Mystery is a story about the Nine Realms and everything that takes place within them." - @PancakeLady #MarvelNBT
"I see a similarity between Sif & Loki because neither of them can be Thor. This more effect on her then she'll admit."  - Kathryn Immonen
"Sif is not just a warrior. We've often seen her leading the charge, but I don't feel like we've ever seen her in charge." -Kathryn Immonen
"So much of their conflict is internalized because they don't have alter egos. They're almost more human because of that." - Kathryn Immonen
"What's most interesting to me about the Asgardians is the inevitability of them." - Kathryn Immonen #MarvelNBT
"There will be familiar faces showing up, but none I think anybody would expect." - Kathryn Immonen #MarvelNBT
"One of the  interesting things about Sif is that she's defined by absence." - Kathryn Immonen #MarvelNBT
"For Sif, what she wants above all is to be a better warrior. How far would she go for that?" - Kathryn Immonen #MarvelNBT
"Kathryn was at the top of my list as far as character as well as keeping things interesting and quirky." - Lauren Sankovitch #MarvelNBT
Kathryn Immonen is participating in #MarvelNBT liveblog, the new writer of Journey Into Mystery beginning in November with issues #646!

"I didn't hire a woman to write Avengers I hired Kelly Sue...for the same reasons I've hired and will continue to hire writers"-Tom Brevoort
"I'm very interested in making sure women knowing that wanting to work in this industry is not peculiar." - @kellysue #MarvelNBT
"The first arc is kind of an Amazing Race thing where the Avengers are teaming up and competing with each other." -@kellysue #MarvelNBT
"Never say never." - @kellysue on The Vision appearing in Avengers Assemble  #MarvelNBT
"The voices in my head for Thor, Iron Man, Hulk and Cap are the movie voices..." - @kellysue #MarvelNBT
"Avengers is about a group of diverse yet dedicated people putting aside their differences to make the world a better place." Tom Brevoort
"I have ideas about why the individual members do what they do, and it's interesting to butt them up against one another..." -@kellysue
"If Cap or Thor are there, you can have Quasar or Machine Man. They may not be in the movies now, but wait til Avengers 9!" - Tom Brevoort
"I really like large casts. It's in some ways a more comfortable way for me to write. I like to rotate point of view." -@kellysue #MarvelNBT
"I'm interested in new media ideas. ...How does the age of the Internet affect the Avengers' public persona?" - @kellysue #MarvelNBT
"...When I saw the movie, I managed to keep it together until Iron Man came onscreen and Back in Black blared." - Kelly Sue DeConnick
@kellysue is a "unique voice we wanted to see on a larger stage." - Marvel Lauren Sankovitch #MarvelNBT

The new HBO show, "Luck" is great television.  If you love horse racing, you'll double love luck. It's superb.  I wish I was in it!

Did you see Drive? Albert Brooks deserves best supporting actor for his role, don’t you think? It was an amazing performance.
Here's my question of the day: how does the guy who DRIVES the snow plow GET to the snow plow?
I saw "The Artist" yesterday. What an amazing film. Everything about it was terrific.  A real pleasure to watch.
I’m picking all the favorites this weekend: Houston, New Orleans, NY Giants and Pittsburgh.  Thoughts?
There's never been a debate like this! I moderated the Yahoo! News/Funny or Die online debate.  Take a look!  http://t.co/CbMDMqIc
There are three sure things in life: death, taxes and Pittsburgh will beat Denver in the playoffs next week.
We saw a lot of movies over the holidays. Let me say RUN, do not walk, to see War Horse. Easily one of the best movies ever made. TEN stars!
Boy, four days into 2012 and it sure feels different than 2011, doesn’t it?
Happy New Year 2012!!!
And I'm not talking about a scene in a bathroom.  You just never see anyone excuse themselves to do that like in real life.  Think about it!
One last thought for 2011: Have you ever seen a scene in a movie where a character stops the action to use the bathroom? I don't think so.
I want to tip my hat to Dick Clark tonight.  My pals @RyanSeacrest and @andersoncooper do a great job - but there is only one Dick Clark!
Tonight we saw the new Mission Impossible movie. A terrific film that will keep you in your seat.  You won't even get up for popcorn!
I am looking forward to some big NFL games on Sunday. I like Raiders, Broncos, Giants and Bengals.
Happy new year to you all! To me, NYE isn't exciting as it was when I was younger.  But hope everyone has fun, no matter where you are.
Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and happy holidays from the whole gang here!  Hope you're having a great time with family and friends.
And because I know you're wondering...my football prediction for Saturday: Jets beat Giants.
I know people are placed under arrest, but has anyone ever been placed "over" arrest?  Just asking...

I saw “The Debt” this weekend.  Loved it.  It’s a terrific thriller and a heart pounding movie that keeps you on the edge of your seats!
Beautiful 9/11 memorial at Beverly Hills City Hall just opened. Worth a trip if you’re in southern California. They did a great job with it.
Best wishes to @andersoncooper as he begins his trek into daytime TV with today’s premiere of @anderson.  Hope you have a great run!
We did shows for 60 consecutive nights after 9/11. I'll never forget walking through the rubble and visiting the burn center.
Like all of you, I'm remembering 9/11/01 today.  That incredible day is in my head forever.
Ok, here are my picks for the weekend: Notre Dame upends Michigan.  And for the pros: Arizona over Carolina; Cleveland defeats Cincinnati.
My friend Cal Fussman has a brilliant piece on Esquire.com about training as a sommelier at Windows on the World.  You should check it out.
This is what I live with RT @shawnieora In my bathroom...the phone just rang and I picked up the blow dryer and said hello...
The problem when so many people are "debating" is that it becomes more like mini-speeches than a true debate.  But it will be interesting.
I'm looking forward to the Republican debate tonight.  Are you all watching it?
As I told you last week, it was announced today that Meryl Streep will be one of the Kennedy Center honorees this year. She's amazing.

Do you have any paraprosdokians to share??
To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism. To steal from many is research...
Evening news is where they begin with “good evening” and then proceed to tell you why it isn’t...
Some examples: Light travels faster than sound; this is why some people appear bright until you hear them speak.
My friend Barry taught me a new word: paraprosdokians. A figure of speech in which the end of the sentence is surprising or unexpected.
I predict the debt ceiling mess will end at midnight on the 2nd.  It’s always that way.  What do you think?
If there was every a reason for instant replay in baseball, it was the horrible call that ended the Pirates game last night.  Absurd.

Cannon's 11 yr. old brother Chance starts his little league season in March. He's a two time all star. My boys do not take after me.

While a lot of people know how funny our 10 yr. old Cannon is, they should know that he' a great football star. His flag team won it all...
Congrats to Blyleven & Alomar on making it to the Hall of Fame.  Most deserving!   Trammell, Murphy & Raines all deserve to be there too…

The only sure thing in NFL playoffs is New Orleans over Seattle.  I know it’s hard to win in Seattle. The other games are too close to call.
