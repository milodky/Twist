Sarah Jones loves twitter - and I adore Sarah...
I'm getting ready to leave for Mumbai today
@kokoe2 thx was good seeing you too
@harveymilk thx so much
I'm a huge fan of Seth's j
Testing new twitterberry app. Testing testing...
Just got back from introducing Vusi Mahlasela at UVA. Struck by his message of hope and the need to continue to fight social injustice
But if all humans magically disappeared tomorrow, within 50 years almost all other life forms on earth would flourish like never before.
Learned at conference yesterday: If all insects magically disappeared tomorrow, within 50 years almost all life on earth would be gone.
http://twitpic.com/157h <- Dinner for Surf Summit conference is on the beach tonight.
So cool that MC Hammer has really embraced Twitter! @mchammer - wish you were here in Cabo too, weather is awesome... see you in Vegas soon!
Thanks to everyone who sent me links to Intel wifi surfboard... will have to use this next time I surf :) http://tinyurl.com/4n89hb
Sir Ken Robinson speaking now at SIMA Surf Conference - "Leading a Culture of Innovation". He is telling Las Vegas jokes (he's from England)
First time, managed 2 catch a wave & actually stand 4 awhile. @zappos_fred took pix of me walking w/ surfboard like I knew what I was doing
Had no idea surfing was such a hard workout. Arms will be sore tomorrow. My nipples are very chaffed from surfboard wax. Thought I'd share.
Headed to beach w/ @zappos_steve @zappos_alfred  to try surfing 4 first time, before conference starts. Thanks Oakley for giving us lessons!
Left rest of Zappos crew, headed back 2 hotel. Maybe try surfing for first time tomorrow b4 conf starts. Met lots of surf brands tonight.
http://twitpic.com/143e <- What does it mean when everyone else is hanging out in bar at Cabo but all of Zappos crew is on blackberri ...
http://twitpic.com/1432 <- For some reason Squid Roe reminds me of movie "From Dusk to Dawn", except no Salma Hayek or vampires. Yet.
http://twitpic.com/142h <- Did obligatory shot of Cabo Wabo tequila, now at Squid Roe.
http://twitpic.com/1424 <- At Cabo Wabo
They are well prepared here. Every seat on the bus has a barf bag like you get on airplanes. Except I don't think these are for turbulence.
About to get on big bus for downtown Cabo pub crawl. This is an officially scheduled event of the SIMA Surf Summit. I like this conference.
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that in all my presentations now I spend about 5 minutes at the end telling people to sign up for Twitter. :)
Presentation I gave today at SIMA Surf Summit - "Building a Brand that Matters" - http://www.slideshare.net/zappos/zappossima051508
Hotel security finally believed @zappos_fred, rescued me after 45 mins. Asked 4 ID so I could come in from balcony. No ID = stay on balcony
Hotel front desk is telling @zappos_fred it's not possible for me to be locked out on balcony. I assure you it is, I am not pretending.
Went 2 my room after my speech, came out 2 balcony. Balcony door somehow locked behind me so now I am trapped outside. @zappos_fred 2 rescue
Just finished sound check 4 my speech. Cool: my BlackBerry 8210 acts as USB flash drive as well, so no laptop req'd, just copied from BB!
Thx everyone 4 ideas/suggestions, incl remove NY affiliates, join Amazon in lawsuit, stop shipping to NY, etc. We will explore all of them!
We don't have a physical presence in NY. Amazon is trying to fight it via legal, but as of right now, we have to start collecting June 1.
Ack! NY state sent us notice: Starting June 1, collect sales tax on all NY orders. Ideas anyone on how to protest? Stop shipping to NY?
Okay I am obviously too tired to type, making lots of typos... Maybe I should sleep some more and wake up early instead...
e emailyogi that is funny re: dentures, wished i witnessed that! :)
Took a 2 hour nap, missed most of the Surf Summit reception party tonight. Gonna try to get work done tonight, before my speech tomorrow.
Then I found out "hieio" means "ice" in Spanish. I feel stupid.
I thought it was pretty cool that the Sheraton in Cabo had signs saying "hello ice" next to the ice machines. Gives the brand personality.
SIMA surf conference in Cabo cool. Dress code: shorts & t-shirt. Specifically prohibit suits. Good thing because my brother & I share a suit
A giant bug flew into @zappos_fred 's eye. Now he is all bug-eyed. Welcome to Cabo Fred!
Landed in Cabo! Waiting outside for @zappos_alfred @zappos_fred @zappos_steve b/c they checked luggage. It's hot and humid here.
At Vegas airport with Zappos folks, about to fly to Phoenix, then Cabo, to speak at SIMA Surf Summit conference. Never been to Cabo before!
Dude, @el_gato seriously, why are you so high maintenance? I'm leaving yardhouse now, headed back home. You are a cat. You need to chill.
Long crazy day. Headed 2 Yardhouse 4 a drink 4 @krianbalma birthday. Finally converted my cat @el_gato to join Twitter (was very reluctant).
Just finished speech and lunch at Community 2.0 conference, headed back to the Zappos office now.
I also asked my cat El Gato this morning re: press release, if anyone had tried to contact him? El Gato was non-responsive to my questions.
Getting press inquiries re: DSW press release of lawsuit against Zappos. Don't know much yet, DSW didn't call or write our legal team first.
Thanks everyone for support, it really means a lot to me. Still in shock hearing about this via press release. Will find out more tomorrow.
Just checked with Zappos legal team and haven't received any communication (phone call, letter, email) from DSW, just press release. Weird.
Press release claims we were using DSW store photographs to mislead people. Obviously Zappos would never intentionally do that.
Weird, just found out through a PRESS RELEASE that DSW filed a lawsuit against Zappos. Maybe phone call, letter, or email more productive??
Back at home, beef jerky for dinner. 30 minute wait at Great Clips for a 9 minute haircut. I'm just glad I don't look like a Q-Tip anymore.
@mike626 We still overnight as much as before, we just don't advertise it so you get it as a surprise if you order free shipping!
At Great Clips waiting 4 my $12 haircut so I can look pretty 4 my speech at Community 2.0 conference at Red Rock Casino in Vegas tomorrow.
@iAlbert Thanks for the eatsleeptweet.com [http://eatsleeptweet.com] shirts - got them today! We will be giving them away to Zappos empl ...
Wife of @zappos_alfred told him he's not allowed to twitter in the bedroom. So I asked him whether he was enjoying sleeping on the couch.
Ran out of cat food this morning, so I fed El Gato some canned tuna that I had in my pantry. I think El Gato thinks it won the cat lottery.
Running late to BBQ at @zappos_steve house. Got caught up in work & stopped by tmobile store, got new wifi blackberry pearl 8120.

Excited that after almost 9 years, Merrell FINALLY allowed us to sell their shoes on Zappos! http://www.zappos.com/n/br/b/439/Merrell.html
I didn't even know we sold these. This page makes me feel funny, like they are all staring at me: http://tinyurl.com/3fttl7 - Is it just me?
Slept in backyard cabana last night, felt like camping. El Gato (cat first showed up 2 yrs ago) woke me up licking my toes. Freaked me out.

Airport bathroom: guy tries washing hands - auto faucet motion sensor broken. He tries voice recognition instead by yelling "Wash!" at sink
Long day, visited 5 startup companies back to back over past 7 hours. Grabbing quick bite before heading to airport to fly back to Vegas.
Leaving Twitter HQ, cool meeting all the Twitter employees. Headed to Get Satisfaction HQ with Zappos gang.
Drinking red bull, hanging out at Twitter HQ w/ other Zappos folks. Cool office. We just learned safest place on a plane is in the back.
Texted re: Zappos airport bin ads. Wanted to say I hadn't seen bins yet. Blackberry turned it into "I haven't seen Zappos airport nuns try"
At least my meetings today w/ Twitter, Get Satisfaction, Next Internet, etc. r w/ people who were at event last night so won't be too weird
Had Zappos written w/ red Sharpie on left hand for party last night. Woke up & somehow half of it transferred to my face & won't wash off.
Naan n Curry in SF is delicious, especially after happy hour. After 11 PM I think they should call it Naan n Blurry.
SF people: Zappos crew and friends on way to Naan n Curry in Union Square across from Hilton. Come join if you are hungry or want to hang.
Also thx to @missrogue @tempo @laughingsquid @mchammer (the real mc hammer!) for all your help! Let's do another random party sometime :)
Thanks everyone in SF for showing up at zappos twitter experiment party! It was fun. Thx twitter employees for coming!

Ok, here's the Zappos twitter experiment!  20 Zappos employees have invaded SF and we want to meet our twitter friends tonight!
SF people: next step - now use a permanent marker and paint your face to look like a zebra. Just kidding. Real announcement coming soon.
In SF now, checking in soon. Excited about today's Zappos twitter experiment, more details to be announced soon. No idea what will happen.
SF people: You should already have Zappos with box around it written on left hand. Now write your @twittername on right hand. More info soon
Everyone in SF: draw rectangle around the zappos on your left hand. No photo, unless u haven't sent one yet. More info later, about to fly.
Yeah everyone ignore that last part, too distracted with airport situation to twitter correctly.
Tell him to show up at 530 so we can twitter about it before it starts.
A bit stressed.  @zappos_Steve and I were booked on wrong flight, waited in long line at United to switch. Hope we make flight to SF.
Got 5 Zappos left hand photos so far, need to get at least 20! Also, don't wash it off yet, more instructions to come if you are in SF area.
If you r in San Fran area, write "Zappos" on back of left hand w/ marker & twitter @zappos link to picture of it. Why? Details to come, 4 PM
Up early to pound through some emails before flying to SF - Red Bull is my friend. Excited to meet Twitter employees, do Twitter experiment.
Trying to interview candidate but the other zappos employees here  brought us grey goose shots in zappos shot glasses. Can't waste alcohol.
The power of twitter. 11 other zappos people are here at blue martini and found me. As @missrogue likes to say, facilitating serendipity.
At blue martini for appetizers and drinks to interview zappos candidate.
Just finished meeting with William Taylor, founder of Fast Company magazine and author of Mavericks at Work. He's working on a new book.
Just finished lunch w/ Planet Hollywood Casino person, brainstorming cool stuff we can do w/ PHC & Zappos customers, employees & vendors!
Today! On Rachael Ray show: Woman goes to Zappos warehouse & picks out 30+ pairs of shoes, whatever she wants, donates old shoes to charity.
I sent @editweapon a Van Halen towel & a $100 Zappos Gift Certificate awhile back. He wants to give away the $100 GC: http://twurl.nl/gn4ivw
Thanks to all who entered our order confirmation free shoes contest! We got a lot of great entries, will announce winner at end of the week!
Making too many typos at this hour... Just got back from "love" show, it was great! Need to go to bed soon, tired...
s sandrad thx for your comments and your support! :)
About to watch "Love" Beatles Cirque du Soleil show. Tix are wedding present for @akacarter & @jimsk8 - They met at Zappos!
Oops, sorry for typo, meant to dm. @cdf12345 had tweeted when he is shopping & sees slim jims, pretzels or red bull, he thinks "shoes" :)
c cdf12345 that is pretty funny, i will have to tell everyone else!
Okay, we are slightly obsessed with Twitter at Zappos. Check out our new business cards: http://tinyurl.com/6ez622
At Zappos Sys/network/IT bbq in Zappos parking lot. They are grilling burgers for everyone until 2 PM for Cinco de Mayo!
Just finished judging Zappos employee salsa competition for Cinco de Mayo. Lots of good entries, my mouth is still burning!
El Gato just puked in my backyard. Pretty gross. El Gato is the cat that showed up in my backyard 2 years ago. He (she?) never left.
Iron man was pretty good. Saw @fitfuel twitter that he's at yard house, gonna stop by to say hi. Apparently we were in the same theater.
Headed to town square to watch Iron Man movie. Wasn't planning on watching it but everyone says its good and I am a lemming.
Made my own version of "pigs in a blanket" by wrapping up a slim jim w/ swiss cheese. I call it "cow wrapped in... cow stuff."
Zappos order confirmation emails are boring. For twitterers only: Win free shoes by writing a better one for us: http://tinyurl.com/3j47d2
Video shoot 4 MSFT over, makeup artist removed makeup 4 me this time! They are headed 2 Zappos offices now & want me to go too. I said no.
Oh great, film crew for MSFT is making me wear makeup again. They are spending all day filming & then will end up using 3 minutes footage.
Wow, feel great, got 10 hours of sleep. Camera crew coming in an hour 4 interview w/ MSFT ppl, taping for event & meet Bill Gates on 5/21.
Headed home 4 a disco nap, try 2 rally later. Its always hard when people visit Vegas, they want 2 party, when you live here its different.
Yahoo live experiment was interesting. Hopefully better internet connection next time. Hanging out in pool cabana watching talladega nights
Thanks all 4 Mac advice. Now if only sprint card would cooperate, streaming sometimes works, sometimes not. Good thing I twitter from phone
Cool, yahoo live seems to work with slow sprint card. 15 viewers right now. Mac screen keeps blanking out for energy save. How to fix?
No idea if this will work or not. On sprint card, not wifi, so much slower...  testing out http://live.yahoo.com/zappos
At wet republic pool party at MGM w/ @skimshady & friends for bachelor party. Perfect weather, I think I'm only one that brought a laptop.
Headed 2 Bellagio 2 pick up VIP tix to "O" cirque du soleil show 4 @Infosourcer (winner of Vegas trip 2 visit Zappos HQ, never been 2 Vegas)
I like @urbannerd idea correlating to unemployment rates, gas prices, inflation, weather, etc. Can also divide up by location, demo, etc
Each follower polled at random time, only once/week. Then create web site w/ graph of global happiness over time, correlate w/ news & events
Idea: Create new automated twitter account, will at random times poll followers w/ question: "On 1-10 scale, how happy r u right now?"
Over 250 Zappos employees on twitter! http://twitter.zappos.com/employees - Twitter classes at Zappos HQ next week by @djjimgreen to grow #
I haven't seen @macknuttie 4 a month but got him signed on 2 twitter. It was weird seeing him 4 first time today, we had nothing new to say
Headed to dinner at Del Frisco's w/ folks from nextinternet.com & @macknuttie @electra @crunchybugs + other nontwitterers. Will convert them
About to fly @jetblue from NY back to Vegas. Weird, pilot says we are going via Canada due to Midwest storms.
@fivehusbands I was not planning on blogging about my debate w/ Suzy Welch b/c I kind of liked having only my Twitter friends know about it
Thx everyone for your tips. Unfortunately I did not pack my makeup remover or cold cream. Showering seemed to help :)
I thought I got rid of it all, but I still have makeup on my face from CNBC taping. This stuff is impossible to get off. How do girls do it?
Met owner of mark ecko & founder of GSI commerce who I haven't seen for years. Back to jersey now, thanks to @gregnyc & his wife. Tired.
back at hotel room, need to get up in a few hours. thanks @gregnyc for a great night, i will hate you in the morning. flying back to veg ...
Was planning on going 2 bed due 2 lack of sleep but @gregnyc forcing me 2 meet him in NY 4 mark ecko party. Says I will sleep when I'm dead
CNBC taping was weird, not what I expected. Only 20 minutes on panel w/ 4 other people. Ended up arguing w/ Suzy Welch (Jack Welch's wife).
I believe in creating culture where employees r inspired, passionate about higher purpose, being part of larger vision, making world better.
Suzy & Jack Welch believe fun in workplace unnecessary, motivate employees primarily w/ money & recognition. I argued better to inspire...
CNBC taping was weird, not what I expected. Only 20 minutes on panel w/ 4 other people. Ended up arguing w/ Suzy Welch (Jack Welch's wife).
I don't know what show, all I know is it's about Gen Y workforce. No, we don't have a deal w/ Twitter, but excited 2 visit them next week!
Maybe if they ask "Tell us what you've been up to?" then I can respond with "Well if you were on Twitter you'd know."
I went w/ pants that are too short instead of pants that are too loose w/ safety pins. Gonna try to work in a Twitter mention somehow...
At CNBC studios, they just put makeup on me, sprayed paint all over my face. On same segment as Jack Welch, not sure what date will air.
@SouthwestAir Twitter takes up a lot of my time, it's just a matter of priorities. I think connecting more deeply w/ customers is important
Manager offers me free breakfast as compensation for no room, no bed. No place else to go so I go to restaurant. They are not open yet. :(
Just got to Clinton Inn in Tennafly, NJ after redeye from Vegas. CNBC booked me here. Hotel manager says hotel oversold, no rooms available
Running late, can't respond to twitters now but thx everyone for all your support & advice (including wearing suspenders and duct tape).
Black slacks fall off when I stand up but if I use safety pins they stay. I hope I can get thru airport security w/  handful of safety pins
In my closet trying on 5 yr old pants to see if they fit. CNBC wants 3 different non blue outfits. Apparently they think I am fashionable.
Headed home 2 pack, taking redeye tonight 2 NY for CNBC taping 2morrow. Producers said no blue but all I have r jeans & blue zappos tshirts
Leaving zappos HR happy hour, headed to monthly meeting over drinks with zappos training team at Remedy's. Busy busy day!

Lunch at claim jumper with CEO of Buy.com - @zappos if you want to give any feedback about buy.com and I will pass on.
Dinner at Dos Caminos again, this time with Schwartz & Benjamin, maker of Juicy Couture shoes, Kate Spade shoes, and other brands.
About to speak to students from local college about enterpeneurship, company culture, passion & chasing the vision instead of the money.
Videos from Zappos merchandising happy hour, including me getting slapped in the face by another employee - http://blogs.zappos.com
Just finished Q&A session with Best Buy. They sent 7 people here to spend a day learning about Zappos culture & customer service philosophy
Retweeting @hippie_nikki - what's more is that i read "smurf summit" too, but didn't think anything of it. just another day in the life!
Funny, @busymom thought I was going to a "Smurf Summit". Zappos is fun and a little weird but I don't think that weird. At least not yet.
Headed to post office to get new passport. Going to Cabo to speak at SIMA surf  summit conf in 2 weeks. Does twitter sms work in Mexico?
People I am with wondering why I am ignoring them and glued to my cell phone twittering. They just don't understand.
He said he doesn't drink. I was confused. Turned out he thought I wanted to take a photo with him. Very different type of shot. :)
I first met @mchammer a year ago at a party. Asked if he wanted to do a shot with me, he said yes. Went to get grey goose, came back and...
At Palazzo now about to eat at Dos Caminos with Lenny founder of bigfoot.com and Tribeca Tables. No cell reception, will twitter later. :(
Just had a great conf call w/ @mchammer (yes, the real mc hammer). Talked about embracing twitter for him and his new company dancejam.com
Retweet @gregnyc Just read a great quote by warren buffet about businesses in bad environment: "you can only tell who is naked at low tide"
Converted someone else to twitter at claim jumper. One person at a time. Still working on Forbes reporter but she is slowly  coming around.
At claim jumper grabbing a drink with @rohitg from imperva and other zappos folks. Stop by!
We decided to photograph and document our red bull + pretzels escapade yesterday: http://www.zappos.com/tonywaffles.zhtml
@solidsmack Alex says biggest single improvement companies can make is creating an authentic culture.
Lunch with Alex Frankel. Author of "Punching In". He's spending 2 days at Zappos to observe! @zappos if u want to say anything him!
Finished eating turkey made by @krianbalma Tried feeding leftovers 2 cat but it ran away again. It probably thought it was red bull pretzel
Computer chose @NinaSpezz as winner! Favorite shoes: http://www.zappos.com/n/p/dp/36739753/c/89.html Favorite core value: Be humble.
Time's up! Will announce winner within 30 minutes. For future reference, our 10 core values: http://www.zappos.com/core-values.zhtml
Twitter @zappos link 2 ur favorite shoes & ur favorite Zappos core value (hint: @missrogue has blog) by 7 PM Pacific. Will pick 1 winner!
Sarah Lacy doesn't like the Zappos TV ads or business model :( http://tinyurl.com/5dpek3
It smelled awful and tasted disgusting. Nothing like waffles at all. Thanks twitter. We tried to give it to the cat but it ran away.
So @krianbalma & I decided to test red bull + pretzels in blender to see if it tastes like waffles (suggestion from a twitterer today).
At home minding my own business, @krianbalma shows up to bake a turkey. I have no idea why. He just showed up with an 8 pound raw turkey.
So we can't afford to give 5% on zappos.com. But if separate zappos.org site with no marketing costs, have enough $ to give 5% to charity.
Thx for all the comments & suggestions! To answer why separate site: we still have marketing costs 4 zappos.com (google, affiliates, etc.)
Would people remember to go to zappos.org directly if there was no promotion for it and it was just through word of mouth?
Thinking of creating zappos.org, which would be same as zappos.com except 5% of sales goes to charity (customer chooses from a small list)
@thenadas Mixing red bull + rolled gold pretzels to make it taste like pancakes sounds absolutely disgusting... I will have to try it!
red bull and slim jims for breakfast. out of corn nuts, boo... gonna spend
today catching up on emails!
Thanks all for your suggestions! Back at home now. Microwaved burrito, salsa, water & vitamin B. What more can you ask for? Life is good.
Emails will contain all tweets of people you follow within past 30 mins or whatever timeframe you set.
Considering developing service that emails all twitters of people you follow every 30 mins. Would that be useful & is 30 mins ok timeframe?
Found some zappos folks at yard house thanks to @graves twitter... the power of twitter! We are about to go into blue martini now.
A town square in Vegas, about to watch movie - "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" or something like that, I forget.
That's what our meeting with michael and Robert is for!
Dinner w/ Gladys Knight's brother Bubba (one of Pips in Geico TV ad) was cool. He told us stories of segregation, weird how wasnt long ago.
At sushi roku with @krianbalma and Bubba, Gladys Knight's older brother!
Parking garage traffic crazy. @krianbalma and I just parked so we can walk back to casino, eat, and come back later.
Was in audience w/ @krianbalma not on the show. Met producers, they were nice. Oprah also interviewed Tina & Cher. Cher was cool, funny.
Just out of Oprah show w/ 4000 people. Tina Turner & Cher performed. Parking lot traffic, went 10 feet in 10 mins. Twitter prevents boredom
Construction traffic on Frank Sinatra Dr. = bad. Not good to be late for Oprah. We don't talk enough as it is. :)
Headed 2 Caesar's Palace w/ @krianbalma for Oprah taping & to meet producers. They said we had to wear bright clothing & no cell phones :(
People asked if Zappos garage sale open 2 public. Answer: Yes! 2280 corporate circle, Henderson NV until 2 PM & some proceeds go to charity
Headed to the Zappos Garage Sale! Lots of employees selling stuff in the Zappos parking lot until 2 PM today, and perfect weather in Vegas!
I never thought this would happen! Here's MY version of how I wound up wearing thigh high boots: http://www.zappos.com/tonyboots.zhtml
At Gaetano's 4 family dinner. Enjoying grey goose martini, blue cheese olives. Bartender hates blue cheese, puts on gloves to make them.
Apparently our blog server can't handle 2500 twitterers at once. Here's an alternate link: http://www.zappos.com/img/tony-boots.jpg
Apparently a Zappos employee was quick to secretly snap a picture & quickly upload me wearing thigh high boots: http://blogs.zappos.com
Photographer did some subliminal trick. Here are the boots I was conned into wearing: http://zeta.zappos.com/product/7397160/color/19916
Not quite sure how it happened, RIS magazine photographer talked me into being shot wearing knee-high high heel sparkly boots to pose in.
Wow! My friend @whatupwilly from SF says he "surfed the same wave as a dolphin this morning.  That's a top 5 life highlight.  Amazing."
Votes were evenly split on music in zappos box idea, so we aren't going  do that idea for now. http://twitter.zappos.com to view comments
What if the same music played when you opened up your Zappos box, like musical greeting cards? Cool? Or too freaky? @zappos your opinion :)
Thanks everyone for your comments on our TV ad! You can read people's thoughts at http://twitter.zappos.com - One more question...
Our new TV ad is at bottom of our home page at http://www.zappos.com - What do you guys think of the commercial? @zappos your thoughts!
Good conversation but sad :(
Outside talking to Tim still about his dad dying
Lots of bad karaoke still going on at zappos merchandising happy hour. If you are not a good singer, you should join the party at inn zone.
So @fitfuel giving away 2 kanye west tix tomorrow in Vegas. Twitter @fitfuel & @zappos your favorite kanye west song by midnight to enter
Hanging out w/ zappos folks & @fitfuel at happy hour @ inn zone. Employee skits were pretty cool and funny. Anyone bought from fitfuel.com?
Headed to Inn Zone @ St. Rose/Eastern for our quarterly Merchandising Team recognition meeting, skits, karaoke, and happy hour!
Just finished entertaining & playing games for 45 mins with 100 screaming Zappos kids! We played lots of games, boys vs girls. Girls won!
Headed 2 office soon for Take My Daughters/Sons To Work Day! Hundreds of kids running around. We will put them to work, free child labor :)
Headed to Dos Caminos at Palazzo w/ Zappos team. If anyone goes to Dos Caminos in Vegas, say Zappos when making reservations 4 free dessert
Only 1 hour of sleep, headed to Stratosphere for an offsite. I'm going to hook up an iv so red bull can go directly into my blood stream.
Back in Vegas, just got home. Pretty tired, but tons of email and twitter msgs to catch up on, lots of red bull tonight I guess!
Zappos employees: when you see Brandis from HR tomorrow, if she rolls her eyes it means she wants u 2 ask her 2 tell story of BB and toilet
At SF airport waiting with blackberry toilet girl to fly back to Vegas. Trying to convince her to join twitter with user name bbtoilet
At Axis Cafe on 8th St, cool place. Ordered tomato soup, reuben sandwich & pomegranate mimosa. I'm starving, eBayers ate but not me :|
Also told eBay CEO and everyone else to embrace twitter. Headed to SF now to eat late lunch with blackberry toilet girl and friends.
Just finished mtg w/ eBay CEO and bunch of senior VPs. Thx everyone for eBay comments, I read some out loud and will email eBay CEO rest
EBay wants to know what they should be doing better? Please @zappos your response and I will pass on to president.
At eBay about to give speech. Person who I picked up at airport, who will remain nameless (Brandis), dropped her blackberry in the toilet.
About to pick up someone from SFO, asked her to get diet red bull. Blackberry changed it to fury red bull. She asked if it was new flavor.
About to meet @tempo for coffee. He is CEO&cofounder of getsatisfaction.com - cool company focused on customer service!
Thanks @sfgirl @selenakyle for getting me eBay info. @krismon giving updates on office outage (doesn't affect site, just email and phones)
Normally I would feel disconnected from the world without email but it's not so bad now thanks to Twitter. I sound like a Twitter ad.
I'm supposed to drive from SF to eBay to give my talk, but they have multiple addresses and I can't access my email to find out where :(
Great seeing new twitterers @eleen @jennlim @nalin415 @macknuttie last night! Not so great: waking up this morning, our office network down
We sang "Picture" by Kid Rock and Cheryl Crow. Apparently no one else at the bar has ever heard that song.

@bestwaymovers Probably not. More likely, it's just the way the season unfolded.
Antonio Cromartie is now the #NYJets #1 Cornerback. This is why it's tough being a Jets fan.
The #Nats, at 93-61, share the best record in baseball. They also don't have one regular starter hitting over .300. #AllAboutPitching
@Bienko @JohndMeyer I don't forget anything...especially when I win!
I would love to see the #Pirates go 6-2 in their last 8 games and finish over .500 for the first season in a long, long, long time.
Only 1 spot remains in the NL playoff race. In the AL, everything is up for grabs! A tale of two seasons. #MLB

@GeminisCordova No, but my college roommate wrote the screenplay.
