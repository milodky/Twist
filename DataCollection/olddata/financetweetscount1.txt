Page:3*count:131-->A8c: Find out info about prospects on LinkedIn...common interests & connections. You can also get info on competitors. #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:132-->A8b: Selling is 90% preparation/10% presentation. LinkedIn is a big help getting you to the 90% mark. #smallbizpgh

Page:3*count:152-->@HowardLewinter Like Dr. Seuss once said "sometimes the questions are complicated & the answers are easy." #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:153-->RT @HowardLewinter: Ask yourself: How does your competition use the internet and social media? #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:154-->A5b: the rule with any #smallbiz is "when in doubt, ask." If you're not sure about customers using SM, ask them. #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:155-->A5: It depends on the #smallbiz. Start by asking current clients LOTS of questions on how they use the Internet for business.  #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:156-->@fleejack And that doesn't include my family! #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:157-->@HowardLewinter It's as if you come to a party bearing gifts... #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:158-->RT @HowardLewinter: If you participate in social media and you provide relevant content there will be customers who find you. #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:159-->A4c: Go to where the chats are taking place. If you go to a SM site & no one in your business is using itÉleave! #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:160-->A4b: Once you find your potential customers, see if industry experts use the same site. What about competitors? #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:161-->A4: Ask them what SM tools they use for biz. Also ask current customers. Then, learn how to engage w/ them on those sites. #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:162-->@fleejack First find one expert whom you trust, then ask them who they "follow." Also check LinkedIn for recommendations. #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:163-->A3c: A good #entrepreneur is someone who absolutely loves what they do. That love is what carries them through the bad times. #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:164-->@HowardLewinter All the NY Giants fans just "groaned." #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:165-->@bridges4biz A3b: Someone who knows the bitter taste of defeat & works like hell never to taste it again. #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:166-->@bridges4biz A3: By ÒgoodÓ I assume you mean successful. ItÕs someone who understands the risks and plans accordingly.  #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:167-->@HowardLewinter Great point Howard. #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:168-->RT @HowardLewinter: After social media, how about some old fashioned selling? Contact your potential buyer & present yourself. #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:169-->Good questions so far... #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:170-->A2c: Check out industry/community sites. Network w/ like-minded #smallbiz. What marketing works for them? Fewer mistakes 4 you! #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:171-->A2b: Find out which SM Tools your customers/prospects are using. No sense in building a FB page if no one visits it. #smallbizpgh
Page:3*count:172-->@gouterbridge Thanks Glen. Every #smallbiz should be checking out #eyeme. It's next generation of social media! #smallbizpgh
