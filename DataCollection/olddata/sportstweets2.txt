Chargers 31 Chiefs 13 Final.
Welcome to Football Follies, Chiefs edition.
Shaun Draughn just tied Jamaal Charles for the Chiefs rushing TD lead with 2. Matt Cassel has the only other TD run for KC all season.
The Chargers defense scores its 2nd straight TD. When it rains it pours for the Chiefs who have yet to hold a regulation lead this season.
There have been 33 passes and 33 runs so far between the Chargers and Chiefs after that Charles burst.
Over #kcchiefs last seven quarters Jamaal Charles has 13 rushing yards on 11 carries. #whatsgoingonwithplaycalling
Chargers go up 10-0 on a Nick Novak FG.

Third TD of the Year for Antonio Gates. He hasn't had fewer than seven since his rookie season.
Very impressive pre-game festivities in San Diego featuring U.S. service men, women and treasure. #flyover #patriotic
The last 100-yard rushing games for SD vs. KC were LaDainian Tomlinson's twice in 2007, two of 22 such games for SD vs. KC.
The last Chief to rush for 100 yards in a game against SD was Larry Johnson in 2006. Has only happened 15 times.
The #KCChiefs are 52-51-1 against the #Chargers alltime including the AFL and 42-42 since both joined the NFL.

If Dez Bryant's fingertip had hit an inch inside the white paint he would've been the hero and Romo would've been hailed as clutch. #cruel
@seshen Longest 10 seconds ever.
The NFL is a league of inches. Dez Bryant's hand was out of bounds. 6 seconds to go for Dallas trailing NYG by 5. 3rd & 6.
The play is under review.
OAK closed out KC 26-16 sending KC to a 6th defeat, 4th at home. As NFL RedZone pointed out, KC has not led any game. only W was on OT kick.
@TerrazasManny  Not that I know. They've just gone away from him in favor of passes to McCluster. Bizarre.
24 unanswered points. Romo to John Phillips TD erases the Giants lead and the XP puts Dallas in front for the first time today. 24-23.
@AlbanyHDTV I still have Demaryius Thomas to go so it's not over yet.
@BMoreRaven33 @SI_DavidSabino No consistency at all. Has talent but team is one-dimensional. Flex vs. easy opponents only.
Send your fantasy questions to our fantasy roundtable @SI_DavidSabino for a chance to have it answered in an upcoming column.
JPP for the Pick 6 TD. Giants 23 Cowboys 0.
@49ersForTheWin Willis, Bowman. There are plenty. Comment was pro-Jennings, not anti anyone else.
Plenty of good candidates for DPOY. Watt is leader. Jennings (6 picks) now also in the discussion  (w/Matthews, Tillman, etc.).
Tim Jennings joined JJ Watt squarely in the race for NFL defensive player of the year.
Zach Miller's first Seahawks TD silences Ford Field.
If the Packers can't hold on against the Jags at Lambeau it will be as bad if not worse than the "referee" loss in Seattle.
Dolphins defense and special teams have dominated the Jets. MIA hasn't beaten NYJ by >7 pts. in NJ since 2003, ³14 since 1990.
And Megatron makes a catch...ties Whimper, Michael Hoomanawanui and Ben Hartsock for the day.
Guy Whimper has more receptions than Calvin Johnson today.
@BMoreRaven33 In an already suspect passing game he's dropped way behind Josh Gordon. Can't see a scenario I would confidently use him in.
Tremendous play by the Titans special teams on a blocked kick at the end of the first half in Nashville.

Re: Giants HR Q: It's last in the ENTIRE MAJOR LEAGUES.
@MikeinMillstadt The first guess is right.
The #KCChiefs gain 5.6 yards per first-down carry, best in the NFL. The #Steelers are last with 2.94 yards per first-down run.
#SFGiants are one game from winning the World Series. They finished last in '12 HRs with 103. What 3 teams were last in HR but won Series?
@AlbanyHDTV Not a big deal. I have plenty of depth.
@Nateburch63 I prefer Bradshaw.

Maurice Jones-Drew, Jordy Nelson, Rashard Mendenhall, Isaac Redman, Danny Amendola all INCATIVE today.
@seth_shap Brown is expected to play so he's the better of iffy choices.
@jageneta Only way to play it safe is Keller but if you can get one of the Broncos/Cards TEs of David Thomas you can gamble on Graham.

Jared Allen is a man possessed right now.
RT if you think Percy Harvin is the most exciting player in the #NFL. #VikingsFootball
Adrian Peterson breaks off a 64-yard touchdown run off the right side. He now has 122 yards on the day.
Martin is the first player to run for over 100 yards in the 1st half against Minnesota since Shaun Alexander in 2002.
If you didn't know about Doug Martin before, you will now. 64-yard TD reception and run.
Freeney forced 43 fumbles but only recovered three in his career. The active leader in recoveries of opposition fumbles: Ray Lewis (19)
Doug Martin has 106 rushing yards on 14 carries in the first half. 20-10 TB
@jacobga12 you got it!
The correct answer is Dwight Freeney who has forced 43 fumbles in his 11 NFL seasons. John Abraham is next with 41 fumbles forced.
@AWilensky24 Correct!
@SeanMJohnson Second.
Nobody mentioned Julius Peppers who is fourth. Or Robert Mathis in third.
Lots of Ray Lewis guesses. He's tied for 16th with 19.
@JimmyOldham23 correct!
Nobody has it yet. Most forced fumbles among active NFL players.
Since the start of '10 Mike Williams has more TD catches (18) than Larry Fitzgerald (17). tied for 14th w/ Welker, L. Moore, Austin, Maclin.
That was Ronde Barber's 16th career forced fumble. Who has the most among active players?
Josh Freeman may want to roll away from Brian Robison's side (3 knocked down passes).
Touchdown Ponder to Percy Harvin and just like that the Vikings are back in the game.
TD Freeman to Erik Lorig. 10-0 Tampa Bay.
Minnesota's offense has gained 16 yards on its first three possessions. Adrian Peterson has 17 rushing yards. Not a typo.
Bucs take a 3-0 lead on the Vikes in a game that if it keeps going like this will send many viewers over to the #WorldSeries.

@julianabritt We love that enthusiasm, Julie - we're looking to step it up on offense here. #LetsGoJets
#RL Nick Mangold is back on the field, in the Jets offensive huddle and now snapping to Mark Sanchez.
#EA Nick Mangold back on to the field.  Good news.
#EA Jets trail 23-14 with 13 seconds left in the third.  Jets hold to a FG after the surprise onside kick recovered by HOU.
@amandadifilippo Thanks for believing in this team, Amanda. #LetsGoJets
@McClureJL We'll be looking to stuff them here, Justin. #LetsGoJets
@Hargz89 @OfficialJoeJet Joe gave us a great spark on that return. #LetsGoJets
@TheRealBroGallo Joe made an explosive play there. #LetsGoJets
@jyct_ We're still right in this game. #LetsGoJets
@Pika250 That's right, Philip. #LetsGoJets
@Rubzzz123 That was an electrifying play, Jeremy. #LetsGoJets
#RL Joe McKnight does it again. A 100-yard KO return TD, McKnight's 2nd as a pro cuts Jets deficit to 20-14 with 4:38 left in 3rd qtr.
#EA AH that was FAST!  McKnight for 100 yards.  20-14.  Big lift from special teams.
#EA Still a 2 possession game at 20-7, but Jets need something in a hurry.  4:51 left in the third.
@michaelrizz We'll be looking to hold tough here, Michael.
@TheRealMissD We're looking to step it up here, Danielle. #LetsGoJets
@BriLegall We'll be looking to get the ball back here. #LetsGoJets
#RL Jets WR Clyde Gates (shoulder) will not return to this game. C Nick Mangold (ankle) return to this game is questionable.
@XavIsDOPE7 We hope to see Nick back on the field soon.
@SydneyElle9 We're happy to help support such a great cause, Sydney.
#EA Now All-Pro C Nick Mangold is being helped off the field.  Slauson moves to C, Ducasse at LG.
@jcaso13 We'll be looking to get something going here, Jared. #LetsGoJets
@markphaneuf We'll be looking to close this gap in the 2nd half, Mark. #LetsGoJets
@Peter_M_Moore We appreciate the support, Peter. #LetsGoJets
@jessmarymar We're confident this team can come back out strong in the second half, Jessica. #LetsGoJets
@GUYRICHARDS1 Our guys will be fired up to get back out there after the half, Guy. #LetsGoJets
#RL Texans, who came in 4-0, have not trailed in the 2nd half in their 5 games so far this season.
#RL For 2nd straight week, Sanchez tipped INT before half results in opponents' FG. Texans lead 17-7 at half, lead in yards (246-166).
For a 2nd consecutive week, the Jets have a critical turnover in enemy territory before the half.  17-7 Texans.
#RL McCain 86-yd INT-return was longest by Jets opponent since Darren Sharper went 99 yds for TD with Sanchez INT @ NO in 2009.
#RL CB Brice McCain picks off tipped red zone pass, deflected by J.J. Watt, returns 86 yds to Jets 9. Bilal Powell pursuit prevents TD.
@_Ms_Megan That was a tough break, Megan, but we need to step it up and stop them here.
#EA Jets inside the Red Zone.  This drive started at the NYJ 7 - Hilliard's 15-yard gain after the fumble looms large.
#RL Sanchez-to-Jeremy Kerley 36-yd gain to HOU-27. RB Shonn Greene nice blitz pickup. Then Sanchez-to-Chaz Schilens for 10 to 17, Jets TO.
@_jonahqueen Lex made a heads up play there, Joey. #LetsGoJets
#RL Lex Hilliard continues to make plays in his Jets debut--recovers Sanchez strip sack, takes it 15 yds at 2-minute warning.
@Lick_My_SOUL We have confidence in our front office to put the guys on the field that give this team the best possible chance to win games.
#RL Jets still haven't sacked Matt Schaub but they're getting pressure, force Texan QB incompletion on 3rd down. HOU now 2-for-6 on 3D.
@KarlSchif We believe in this team, Karl. #LetsGoJets
#RL Texans LB Brian Cushing (left knee) return to this game is questionable.
@B_gentle We just missed a big play there, Brent.
#RL With Mark Sanchez keeper, Jets have converted 2 fourth-downs in a game for first time since 2010 AFC title game @ PIT.
@oskrsanchez We can't hear that enough, Oscar. #LetsGoJets
#RL Tebow at QB 1st 2 plays this drive, first time he's had 2 plays in a row at QB on same drive for Jets. TT carries 3 yds, Bilal Powell 3.
@caprivc We appreciate the support, Valerie. #LetsGoJets
@tsatt44 We have confidence in our coaching staff to get the guys on the field that put this team the best possible position to win, Tyler.
#EA  Jets struggles against the run continue thus far.  Arian Foster: 7 carries - 93 yards.  Foster was 3 for 42 on that scoring march.
#RL Arian Foster, who had 46-yd burst earlier, follows his 21-yd right sweep with 13-yd TD run inside LB Garrett McIntyre. Texans 14-7.
@DanielleCosmo We appreciate the support, Danielle. #LetsGoJets
#EA Jets can't sustain the momentum after Tebow's 4th down conversion.  7-7 with 13:56 left in the 2nd.
@tiffanyurena We love following our fans, Tiffany. #JetsNation
@JOHNSOTTILE That was a big conversion, John. #LetsGoJets
#RL Fourth-and-2-inches at Jets 25. Tim Tebow, personal protector, makes it 2-for-2 on fake punt runs with 3-yard gain.
#EA Solid opening quarter from Mark Sanchez.  He was 4-of-6 for 69 yards and the 1 score.
@Joseph__Scott We'll be looking to pick up a big win here tonight, Joe. #LetsGoJets
@MikeJohnstonPT That was a well executed play on their part, Mike, but now we're just focused on stopping them here.
#RL That was the Jets' first first-quarter TD in six games all-time vs. Houston.
#RL Mark Sanchez to Jeff Cumberland, 27-yd TD. Only Jets' 2nd TD in last 37 drives since opening with TD @ PIT in Game 2.
@RichieNavarro3 That's right, RIchie. #LetsGoJets
#EA That's what you do with your takeaway Ñ cash it in with points.  Hell of a toss from Sanchez to Cumby for 27 yards. Tied up at the Met.
@RealCoreyOs That was a great connection, Corey. #LetsGoJets
@EvelDick We're looking to make something happen here, Evel. #LetsGoJets
@tfallo22 That was a heads up play, Tara. #LetsGoJets
#EA A. Johnson needs 76 yards for 10,000. It might take awhile because Cro is ready to roll - pick is the game's first takeaway!
@RJWda3rd He made a great play on that ball, Rohan. #LetsGoJets
@Drego101 Antonio was all over that pass, Joe. #LetsGoJets
#RL CB Antonio Cromartie, on WR Andre Johnson deep, picks off Matt Schaub for his 2nd INT of the season. Only 3rd giveaway of yr for HOU.
@IfYouAxMe That was a big time play, Jay. #LetsGoJets

@Peridot2681 - The rematch of Pittsburgh & Baltimore #NFLMobile
@thairandolph - Highlight of my career was three World Championships.

Awesome!  Nick and his staff do a great job! RT @smileyvol: how good is Neighborhood Services?
I guess they're not too concerned with college basketball players since they're considering expanding March Madness to 96 teams.
NCAA would like for us to believe they're concerned about the kids (too many games) so therefore no playoff system.
College Bowls were once awarded to teams for great years; Now they're awarded for mediocrity. Reasons are clear...more revenue.
Cowboys went from a December punchline to a legitimate playoff contender...all within 3.5 hours.
Joe Montana gets my vote. RT @RicNasty: I agree with ur statement Peyton is the most consistent qb. I'm just curious is he the best ever?
Gotta be impressed with Jags too.  Haven't beat many good teams this year.  This would validate them as a playoff contender.
How many times have we seen this performance from Peyton? The most consistent QB - week in & week out - I've ever seen.
