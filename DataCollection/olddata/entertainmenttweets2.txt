"Avengers #1 starts with a big bang. Then we proceed from there." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ #MarvelNBT
"Black Panther is certainly the moral center of New Avengers." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ #MarvelNBT
"Black Panther is the lynchpin character of New Avengers. The central character." @TomBrevoort http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ #MarvelNBT
"Avengers is the day book and New Avengers is night.  One book is about life, one is about death. The logos reflect all this." @JHickman
"I have a responsibility to Marvel to sell copies and a responsibility to the fans to entertain them." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ
"Cannonball & Sunspot are younger characters. It's always good to have those types of figures to bring a fresh viewpoint." @JHickman
"We need new bad guys. I'm making a lot. Will you see  traditional Avengers favorite villains? Of course." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ
"How big must the crisis be versus what happens in the Marvel Universe on an average day to bring these characters together?" @TomBrevoort
"People know from FF what a big thinker Jonathan is & how he plays the long game. It's a bigger canvas here." @TomBrevoort
"The New Avengers/Illuminati roster is Cap, Iron Man & Doctor Strange, plus Black Bolt and Namor." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ
"The books will work in tandem. You don't have to read both, but they are two sides of the same coin." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ
"The New Avengers are real world, they live in the dark, apocalyptic world as it is." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ #MarvelNBT
"The Avengers are the utopian Avengers, the ideal ones we want." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ #MarvelNBT
"One of the first things we all agreed on is that the roster should look more like the world. " @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ
"We see the back story of how Iron Man & Cap have been quietly building a contingency plan for the day that comes in issue #1." @JHickman
