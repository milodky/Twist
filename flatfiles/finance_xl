Cool... See what people are buying from Zappos in real-time! (Warning: may induce hypnosis) - http://bit.ly/zapposmap
RT @garyvee - "Hustle Authenticity Passion Patience & You. How to be happy in business: spelled out HAPPY w/ favorite words"
The radio's morning show is talking about twitter. So now I am twittering about the radio's morning show. The circle of life is complete.
Audio podcast of my #sxsw "Delivering Happiness" talk are at: http://bit.ly/zsxswaudio - Slides at: http://bit.ly/zsxsw
Off to dinner w/ @RealAnnieDuke & @EmilyJillette. I wonder whether the dinner table or poker table will be cheaper with them?
http://twitpic.com/2qunn - I just got challenged to a dance-off by my friend's kid. Sadly, I lost.
At a friend's house and when I walked by a cactus it poked me. Personally, I find that unnecessary and a bit immature.
Dear chapstick fairy: I feel special when you secretly visit, but me losing my chapstick every 1-2 weeks is getting expensive
Hanging w/ @garyvee in the back of the room getting ready to speak at @tonyrobbins #UBMS biz conf about customer svc & company culture!
To save on costs, we installed bunk desks at Zappos. It's actually not as uncomfortable as it looks - http://bit.ly/zbunkdesk

Dinner at CUT, a Wolfgang Puck steakhouse. Cool name, definitely much catchier than if they named the restaurant Cowgang Puck.
Busy day! Great lunch w/ @tonyrobbins after he toured our offices, @livestrongceo coming now for tour, meeting, then dinner!
"In the pursuit of knowledge, something is added every day. In the pursuit of enlightenment, something is dropped every day" -Lao Tzu
Just walked past a mannequin. And as with all mannequins in my peripheral vision, it freaked me out b/c I thought someone was staring at me
Finally landed in Vegas after the plane circled around a few times. I think that's what they like to do before going to sleep for the night.
I hope we can bring this to @zappos offices one day - it makes pizza from scratch in 3 mins! - http://bit.ly/pizzamachine
Enjoyed @davelogan1 's book "3 Laws of Performance". Great stuff, added it to Zappos Library - http://bit.ly/z3laws
Just realized I left 2 shirts in the closet when I checked out of my hotel this morning. I guess the maids will be well dressed tomorrow
Thinking that people who reply-to-all indiscriminately should work on trying to reduce their carbon copy footprint.
http://twitpic.com/2fzoj - On Virgin America flight. For $5 I can offset my carbon footprint. Will try it out

Ivanka Trump: "Most important thing is to love what you do". Also, father taught her "To whom much is given, much is expected"
At Caesar's listening to Ivanka Trump speak before my speech. She gave organizer hard time for not holding conf at Trump hotel next door :)
Twitter's 140 character limit just goes to show that it's the little things that count. #verydeepthoughts
Enjoying one of my favorite meals: hot Reuben sandwich, chicken noodle soup for dipping the sandwich in, and a pickle of course

Happy birthday Twitter! Like most 3 yr olds, u make me feel happy, sad, surprised, overwhelmed. But in the end I still love u.
Had breakfast mtg w/ Zappos board member. Neither of us are morning people. Naptime now (at least for me, I don't track his sleeping habits)
Finished important mtg to determine where tooth fairy keeps all the teeth. Don't know, but it's probably pretty frakin' scary
Weird, someone has been secretly filling our trash dumpster at Zappos w/ LOTS & LOTS of newspapers. Maybe it's the newspaper fairy?
Happy Friday & happy first day of Spring everyone! - ÒNo winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn.Ó - Hal Borland

About to speak at conf. Spilled Coke on left leg of jeans, so poured some water on right leg so looks like the denim fade.
At Austin airport. Thought about pinching TSA for not wearing green today but decided I really wasn't in the mood to go to jail
So @tempo finishes story & cab driver promptly turns music off. Eerily silent now. Driver is either subtle hinter or on twitter
Sharing taxi, @tempo starts telling me a story and cab driver promptly cranks music way up. With great power comes great responsibility.

In green room getting ready for my 2 PM opening keynote at #SXSW Interactive. There is absolutely nothing green about this room
http://twitpic.com/22xeh - I want to go to sleep at my hotel but the sheer number of pillows is intimidating.
Austin is such a great town. Just finished filming for Revision3, now grabbing dinner. My keynote at #sxws is at 2 PM tomorrow!
Flight to Austin delayed & overbooked. Airline needs 2 people to take later flight. They can't fool me, the flight is already later. #sxsw
Busy busy day! Didn't notice any @Zappos employees doing the robot dance at the office today - http://bit.ly/zrobot
Hanging out at HR conf event in Arizona w/ @PhoenixSunsGirl & friends in hot air balloon. She's the one that got @THE_REAL_SHAQ on twitter!

@pleesexplain We appreciate your interest in our country. Come here, see the sights and spend money please.

@toffergrant it's incredible to watch. And then to fathom the actual cost!! Can we get a do-over?
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch Work smarter then...
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch Are they average? There are 314 million people in the U.S. What should the "average" person look like?
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch I'm pretty average.
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch I AM the average citizen (and I used to work for the other guy in our tweet chat ;)
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch You know what people do...they row in the opposite direction so you & your hard work goes nowhere.
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch It would be nice if that's the way America worked. Maybe we wouldn't be teetering on financial collapse then.
@pleesexplain @rupertmurdoch That's one way to see it.
To understand the financial abyss America is facing, go to http://t.co/nQxLmjSR & see for yourself. Ignorance is not an excuse!
@moorehn That really sucks! I bet it was just replaced too...
@rupertmurdoch We either start rowing together or it's every man for himself. I'm happy to pick up an oar if you are.
@YoungCarin Start w/ a heaping portion of the right attitude & mix it w/ focus & a plan of action. Turn on good music while cooking.

@bearclawjackson Start by learning how to use social media properly and build your foundation. Slow & steady wins the race. #smallbizpgh
@bearclawjackson It's never too early to learn about social media for biz. Find internships, connect w/ potential employers. #smallbizpgh
A8c: Find out info about prospects on LinkedIn...common interests & connections. You can also get info on competitors. #smallbizpgh
A8b: Selling is 90% preparation/10% presentation. LinkedIn is a big help getting you to the 90% mark. #smallbizpgh
Q8: LinkedIn is a incredible tool for networking! You can join niche groups, ask questions, give answers.  #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz Happy birthday!! #smallbizpgh
If you know a small biz owner who could use advice tell them to follow #SmallBizPgh and join us every month 7 Ð 8pm.    #smallbizpgh
A7b: A good mix includes events (be a panelist/speaker if you can) + online discussions (Twitter/LinkedIn).     #smallbizpgh
@MamaBritt Well deserved.
A7: Consistency is the name of the game. Effective networking takes time. DonÕt force the conversation & be genuine.     #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: Every experience & failure teaches lessons. Pay attn to the lessons. You will be more successful in biz. #smallbizpgh
@fleejack Great question for @lindahandleyinc. I always suggest local chapters of @SCOREMentors @ASBDC & @SBAgov  #smallbizpgh
@JodiOkun Ask a dealbreaking question upfront (it usually involves $ or expectations). If you don't get the right answer...run. #smallbizpgh
@DiversityWoman Partial list @rieva, @karenkerrigan, @barbaraweltman, @JodiOkun, @mamabritt, @lindahandleyinc, @marketingedge #smallbizpgh
@DiversityWoman I have a list of SMB experts on my Twitter page. Lots of smart, sharp women thought leaders there. #smallbizpgh
@RupiPANAICH It's about engagement. Put info on your FB page that customers/prospects want to see. Then invite them over ;) #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter Only partner with other people/companies if they help can you in achieving your goal. Otherwise, why bother? #smallbizpgh
RT @fleejack: here is an example of the #eyeme app @Abercrombie http://t.co/PVGRdWxg  How #smallbizpgh can make your own ads #smallbizpgh

A6b: Partner with winners. People/companies that have a successful track record. Don't partner with a longshot. #smallbizpgh
A6: Partner w/ any person or biz that can help you reach your goal. Avoid wild goose chases & dead ends at all costs.  #smallbizpgh

@Rieva @bridges4biz now add #smallbizpgh so everyone can read that. Excellent point.
@HowardLewinter Like Dr. Seuss once said "sometimes the questions are complicated & the answers are easy." #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: Ask yourself: How does your competition use the internet and social media? #smallbizpgh
A5b: the rule with any #smallbiz is "when in doubt, ask." If you're not sure about customers using SM, ask them. #smallbizpgh
A5: It depends on the #smallbiz. Start by asking current clients LOTS of questions on how they use the Internet for business.  #smallbizpgh
@fleejack And that doesn't include my family! #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter It's as if you come to a party bearing gifts... #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: If you participate in social media and you provide relevant content there will be customers who find you. #smallbizpgh
A4c: Go to where the chats are taking place. If you go to a SM site & no one in your business is using itÉleave! #smallbizpgh
A4b: Once you find your potential customers, see if industry experts use the same site. What about competitors? #smallbizpgh
A4: Ask them what SM tools they use for biz. Also ask current customers. Then, learn how to engage w/ them on those sites. #smallbizpgh
@fleejack First find one expert whom you trust, then ask them who they "follow." Also check LinkedIn for recommendations. #smallbizpgh
A3c: A good #entrepreneur is someone who absolutely loves what they do. That love is what carries them through the bad times. #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter All the NY Giants fans just "groaned." #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A3b: Someone who knows the bitter taste of defeat & works like hell never to taste it again. #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A3: By ÒgoodÓ I assume you mean successful. ItÕs someone who understands the risks and plans accordingly.  #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter Great point Howard. #smallbizpgh
RT @HowardLewinter: After social media, how about some old fashioned selling? Contact your potential buyer & present yourself. #smallbizpgh
Good questions so far... #smallbizpgh
A2c: Check out industry/community sites. Network w/ like-minded #smallbiz. What marketing works for them? Fewer mistakes 4 you! #smallbizpgh
A2b: Find out which SM Tools your customers/prospects are using. No sense in building a FB page if no one visits it. #smallbizpgh
@gouterbridge Thanks Glen. Every #smallbiz should be checking out #eyeme. It's next generation of social media! #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A2: Social Media! Your biggest investment is time. Your customers & potential customers are online. Go find them. #smallbizpgh
@briantippens Thanks B. Hope you are well. #smallbizpgh
A1c: Many #smallbiz think social media is a fad & it wonÕt help their biz. ItÕs a Òmeans to an end;Ó Get in the game. #smallbizpgh
A1b: No ÒrealÓ biz plan. #Sandy is a stark reminder that #smallbiz WILL be interrupted. Have a plan ÒAÓ and plan ÒB.Ó #smallbizpgh
@bridges4biz A1: Cash Flow! Too many #smallbiz owners donÕt have enough of a safety net to protect them when A/R goes net 90+ #smallbizpgh
@HowardLewinter Great to see you here Howard. #smallbizpgh
@fleejack Social Media could be as important as oxygen or water to some #smallbiz. It's the way we do biz now. #smallbizpgh

To the BusinessInsider  folks who like my page generation, especially Joe W, my Boswell, I like being right more than being controversial
If i predicted a landslide for Romney, Business Insider would get 80,000 more pageviews and be ebitda positive that day
RT @SoDakLiberal:  The Romney people are just generally confused.-j if i predicted a landslide for Romney they would call me a genius.
If you ever say anyone might win, the other side decides you are against them. I think the Giants will win it all, but i hate them!!!
The Romney people seem confused--but the electorals aren't the same as the popular..
Jim Cramer is an idiot who can't pick stocks, sports, or politics which is why no one ever seems to want to hear from him.....

Plus, one more thing, this election is like the stock market, everyone's long a close race. Everyone. So i have to take the other side!!!!
No one is going to recall the guy who picks Obama by 10 electorals if it turns out to be 150 margin.  Believe me.
It might dawn on people scoffing about my call on the election, but i am basically taking the Over on Obama. Everyone else is too close
RT @FreeMrktCptlst: @jimcramer Watching you on @ESPNÉ.nice--thanks!
If you said "the race is close" i could see that, if you say the electorals are close i just don't know how you get that at all.
All polls are focused on popular vote, which is a parlor game. It is the electorals that matter. That's the flaw..why don't people see that?

Thanks @TheAliMonster for locating keys. Thanks twitter for making it so easy. @kevinrose & @garyvee I still think you guys were involved.
No luck finding car key. @zappos_alfred driving me. Dear @kevinrose @garyvee if one of you pickpocketed me please bring key back. Thanks.
Slightly problematic that I seem to have lost my car key. Again. Walking back to claim jumper to try to find. It was my last spare key. :(
Awesome meeting @kevinrose and @garyvee in person... lots of great ideas flowing, can't wait to figure out something cool to do w/ them
About to give @kevinrose and @garyvee a tour of Zappos offices!

Getting my head shaved right now in front of our offices for annual Zappos Bald & Blue day with @zappos_alfred while twittering.
Every year # of employees participating grows, sometimes women shave too. We will be posting pictures at http://blogs.zappos.com after!
Zappos annual Bald & Blue event is today. Employees will be shaving each other's heads and spraypainting heads blue. I will be bald soon.
Back in Vegas. Finished half box of triscuits, slept entire way. Feel much better now, just really worn out. Thx all for the well wishes.
Food poisoning, had chills, throwing up every hour, almost  did in meeting. @zappos_fred driving us back to Vegas. Lying down in back seat.
Just did interview w/  @marklennon explaining why twitter is special. The challenge of expression in 140 chars makes twitter the new haiku.
@kevinrose how long are you in Vegas for?
Will be at shade hotel bar with @zappos_fred until at least 10 PM. Meeting up with Matt from Zappos.TV. Stop by if you are in the area!
Skechers president impressed by twitter, gave away first 9 pairs of shoes in Manhattan Beach store in 30 minutes. He is going to sign up!

Skechers president says first 10 people to show up in Manhattan Beach Skechers store before 830 PM and say "zappos" get 1 pair of free.
Skechers president wants to test out the power of twitter. So he is giving away 10 free pairs of Skechers. Details in next twitter.
Trying to convince Skechers president to join twitter. He wants to know if there are any Skechers fans out there. Twitter @zappos replies!
At bar at Shade Hotel in Manhattan Beach waiting for Skechers CEO. Rooms in hotel are cool, really like desk that rolls & hovers over bed.
Finished lunch at Baja Fresh in Barstow. Sad that Twitter is not delivering all my @ messages to my phone. :( I hope Twitter gets well soon.
Driving to LA with @zappos_fred. Dinner with Skechers CEO tonight, then meeting tomorrow, then back to Vegas.

Just had photo w/ Bill Gates & bunch of CEOs. Afterwards asked him for photo w/ me doing rabbit ears behind him (per twitter suggestion).
Bill Gates speaking at conference - On Microsoft being behind Google on search: "It's kind of fun to be an underdog... It's neat."
Bill Gates speaking now at Microsoft advertising conference, giving presentation... I am in back row, sitting next to CEO of Overstock.com
On way to Microsoft w/ @zappos_fred Looked at agenda, apparently I am supposed to be in photo w/ Bill Gates. I wonder if I can Twitpic Bill.
Thx @kristen_ @yqiang @scarab5 for last minute drinks w/ @zappos_fred and me! It was fun! Bedtime now, early morning tomorrow w/ Bill Gates

Re: Dahlia question, we were discussing w/ Microsoft whether should go there after dinner. We decided 2 say bye 2 msft.. Now in Kirkland, WA
Thanks to everyone who responded about Dahlia in Seattle query. Was trying to show Microsoft that Twitter is a pretty good search engine :)
Anyone know anything about Dahlia restaurant in Seattle? Worth going to?
At Microsoft pre-event dinner with @zappos_fred - no Bill Gates in sight but Patrick Byrne CEO of Overstock.com is here.
Just landed in Seattle. Press event w/ Bill Gates and Microsoft tomorrow re: search advertising. I wonder if Bill will talk to me this time?
Different TSA employee then places bowl with cell phone on top of my laptop, which leaves big circular mark on laptop that won't come off.
TSA again unapologetic, says not their problem, accuses me of placing bowl on top of laptop. I wish TSA was not a monopoly.

Wing Lam (founder of Wahoos Tacos) wants to know what people think of Wahoos. Twitter @zappos with your feedback if you've eaten there, thx!
@markdavidson hey mark, I just want to let you know that I work for zappos.
Back in Vegas, it's hotter here than it was in Cabo. Headed to MGM to meet Wing Lam, founder of Wahoos Tacos, at Country Music Awards party.
Reading "Tribal Leadership", found via twitter. Good so far describes same thing we r trying 2 do: company culture & make world better place
http://twitpic.com/17ni - Bye bye Cabo. Thanks for the memories. Also thanks for the fun stuff we can't remember.
Enjoying last meal in Cabo. We decided to cut our trip short, too much to do this week. Plus I need to spend some quality time w/ @el_gato
In taxi on way to go jetskiing with @zappos_fred & @zappos_steve
Woke up confused this morning on top of bed covers still in my jeans. Vaguely remember thinking "I'll just close my eyes for a minute..."
Also makes body shots easier. Add Vitamin B to mix, make organic, healthiest combo ever. @diy_eleen makes lip balm, will ask her 2 research
Add sunscreen, lip balm, and alcohol to the combo so 6-in-1. Hang out at beach or take a shot of 6in1 at party if bored. Never get sunburnt.
Survey: would you buy 3 oz bottle that was 3 in 1 combo of toothpaste, shaving cream & lotion for travel? Lotion smell but toothpaste taste.
Idea: Save best twitter msgs, put them randomly inside fortune cookies (perfect msg length). Serve in Chinese restaurants, entertain diners
Twitter improves lives: Normally bad situations (balcony lockout, lost wedding ring) make good twitter stories & rest of world entertained.
Typo tweet from @zappos_alfred: "Anyone w/ a mental detector met us at the Office in Cabo. I will buy dinner and drinks." He is distracted.
Dinner on beach @zappos_alfred drops wedding ring. 8 people, 20 mins digging thru sand, no ring. Can't contact wife, twitters, needs Patron.
We had a patron silver shot. I have a feeling @zappos_alfred will need another one very very soon. Wait for his twitter update to learn why.
http://twitpic.com/16s4 <- At "The Office" restaurant on the beach in Cabo. Wish I had an office like this.
Spent all day in hotel room,  email catch up. Avoided balcony. Headed 2 downtown Cabo now 4 "The Office" restaurant recommended via twitter!
