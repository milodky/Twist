Congratulations to 2012 Sprint Cup Champion Brad @Keselowski
Bill Belichick's defense is feasting on Andrew Luck in today's blowout. Second pick-six of the day.
@PTP819 You're a Cowboys fan, right? Close call today.
Chris Ivory came close to breaking another one. A 25-yard run wasn't bad in any case.
@PTP819 Ha! Yes Schaub was incredible but nobody thought the Jags would stay in the contest. Freeman wasn't awful (3 TDs)
Give one back. The officials overturn the last fumble by Rod Streater.
The Saints defense is on a takeaway mission today. Three turnovers by the Raiders.
In his first game for a new team Aqib Talib pays instant dividends for the Patriots on a 59-yard TD return of an Andrew Luck interception.
@TerrazasManny 7 runs for 55 yards.
Andre Johnson ends up with 273 yards including the game-winning 48-yard overtime game winning TD.
Dan Bailey's 38-yard FG gives Dallas a 23-20 OT win over Cleveland.
Bucs complete the stunning comeback on a Freeman to Dallas Clark TD in OT.
Freeman and Jackson convert the 2-point play. Tie game likely headed for OT.
A bullet throw from Josh Freeman to Vincent Jackson for a 24-yrd TD puts the Bucs a 2-pt try from a tie in Carolina.
Entering today only Troy Aikman (15) had more 4th Q comebacks for the Cowboys than Tony Romo (14). Next Roger Staubach (13) Danny White (11)
Touchdown Benjamin Watson from Brandon Weeden to give the Browns the lead and quiet the Jerrydome. Still 1:07 to go
Matt Ryan now has thrown FIVE interceptions.
The answer: The only other Jaguar to throw 4 TDs against the Texans was Quinn Gray on Dec. 30, 2007. That game was also in Houston.
Great catch by Randall Cobb to adjust to the ball in the end zone between two defenders for a 22-yard TD grab.
@Awade21 That's the one.
Hint: the answer to the Jaguars 4 TD Q is NOT Steve Buerlein, Mark Brunell, Byron Leftwich or David Garrard.
Chad Henne is the second #Jaguars QB to throw for 4 TDs against Houston. Who was the first?
Romo to Dez Bryant puts the Cowboys ahead of Cleveland.
Ok, who had Chad Henne with four TDs and Matt Ryan with four INTs today? #OppositeDay
Bilal Powell scores his second rushing TD of the quarter for the Jets. Shonn Greene owners beware.
Megatron with leap, a score, and a stuff over the goalpost.

@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino McGahee
Cecil Shorts strikes again. 67-yard score from Henne.
Captain Munnerlyn with a 74-yard pick six of Josh Freeman. Still 10-7 Tampa Bay.
Aaron Rodgers to Jermichael Finley. TD Packers.
Two QBs have thrown three 1st Q INTs in past 4 years: Peyton Manning 9/17/12 vs Atlanta and Matt Ryan today for Atlanta.
Dalton to AJ Green gives the Bengals the lead. Only the Ravens on opening day have kept Green out of the end zone this year. #AllPro
@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino There's a long way to go.
@DrSamMorris scored in OT.
Nick Foles is having a tough starting debut so far. Two picks in the 1st Q.
In what's become routine Chad Henne replaces an injured Blaine Gabbert for the Jags in Houston.
After not holding a lead all season, KC grabs an advantage for the second week in a row. KC 3, Cin 0.
LaRod Stephens-Howling scores the 10th rushing TD of the season against the Falcons. Cards take the early lead.
@JTWarmoth7 Jones.
@Semery10 None are good choices but roll with Brown.
Send your #fantasyfootball questions/comments to @SI_DavidSabino throughout the week and here on Sunday pre-kickoff for lineup help.
@HazelAcev Freeman. Been outstanding recently.
@Semery10 Sproles should play. I like him better than DWill. TB very tough vs. run.
@bhayden21 Tough spot. Smith and cross fingers Flacco can get it to him.
Colts play at the Patriots today.  Including playoffs Tom Brady has topped 300 pass yards once in 8 career games vs. Indy at Foxboro ('04)
@Boomerseven No. I like Turner more for touchdown potential.
@LynnKupfer I'd go with James Jones but the other two should have good days too.
@mgugs46 Have to figure Cooper and Foles have worked a lot together in practice. Not a bad play over Shorts.
@margolin23 I like James Jones today vs. Detroit. The Pack should be fresh after a week off.
@LynnKupfer All are great but Mike Williams is the safest bet with Jones ailing.
Greg Jennings, Kevin Kolb, Joe Haden, DeMarco Murray, Mike Vick, Jason Avant, Andrew Hawkins all inactive for today's early games.
@margolin23 I like Alexander vs. the Broncos.
@deafjeffm  Garcon for Roberts is interesting. I'd probably do that.
@LynnKupfer @SI_DavidSabino I'd use Rivers who will find Gates a lot. Foles has a good matchup but no idea how he'll handle his 1st start.
@HazelAcev Both have major questions. I'd use Jones and hope he can gut it out the entire game.
@vtgoad I'd use Young. GB backs have been a major disappointment since Benson went down.
@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino @Playoffs You too. Let's get that 5-5 team a little better.
@vtgoad I'd use Romo.
RT @ChrisBurke_SI: Pierre Garcon, Julio Jones ready to go: NFL Week 11 key actives/inactives http://t.co/JsiO6pqD

@TerrazasManny Jones playing but could be limited. Mathews also iffy. I'f you have strong alternatives use them.
@pkeithb81 I like Bradford but Foles has a good matchup. Question is can he handle it? Not sure.
@PTP819 I'd go with Freeman and Witten.
@wilkentj Davis invisible recently and Bears tougher vs. TE. Vereen strictly a complementary player.
@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino Austin.

Bills win. Send your fantasy Qs to @SI_DavidSabino throughout the wek or here on Sunday AMs.
Davone Bess gets his first TD of the year. Amazingly Miami i now down just five points 19-14.
Knicks remain undefeated, go to San Antonio and beat the Spurs 104-100.
Reggie Bush thru the first 5 games: 417 rushing yards. Over the last 4.5 games: 138 rushing yards including net zero on 7 carries tonight.
Dolphins 50 net yards of offense, 0-5 on third down, allowed four first downs on penalties.
For the Dolphins to have played so poorly yet be just 12 down at the half is astounding. Buffalo 19-7.
Classic alligator arms for Tashard Choice on that last pass.
Time of possession: Buffalo 10:18; Miami 3:59.
96-yard kickoff return by Marcus Thigpen. TD Miami. 10-7 Bills. It's all special teams.
79 Yard punt return for Leodis McKelvin. Buffalo 7-0.
@BreakdownSheets you got it.
@jwjunker Correct
Bonus question: Before Miggy and JV who were the last pair of Detroit Tigers to win back-to-back MVPs?
@McFleet711 Admiration and a feeling of satisfaction.
The last AL team before the Tigers to have different MVPs in back to back seasons was the Rangers: Juan Gonzalez '98, Pudge Rodriguez '99
@REALGeoNio Nope
@peters_dylan Right
@dkuhn119 They did it in NL. Who did in AL?
@purdmanJR Correct.
@Curtos07 Yes
@WAF2004 Got it.
Miguel Cabrera followed Justin Verlander as #MVP #Tigers. What was the last AL team to have consecutive MVPs won by different players?
@deafjeffm Yes. Better than Allen.
Miami opponents average 42.0 pass attempts/game. If it remains that high It'll be the most against any AFL or NFL team in history.
The temp is in the low 30s for tonight's game. Miami's record in the last six sub-40-degree games at Buffalo: 3-3.
@BMoreRaven33 @SI_DavidSabino No forgetting that. But the Jets are a mess on offense. I'd stick with Boldin despite the tough matchup.
It's confirmed that Fred Jackson is inactive for tonight's Bills-Dolphins game making C.J. Spiller a great fantasy start.

@epicmess indeed.
Who was the last Raiders QB to win in the Eastern time zone? Bruce Gradkowski 12/6/2009
TD Donald Jones. Bills pull to within a FG with the XP.
Today's 55 points are the most in a game for the Ravens and ties the most against the Raiders.

Dalton's dismantling of the Giants continues. The latest TD goes to Sanu.

Chris Johnson escapes the Dolphins D to give the Titans a two TD lead in Miami.
Peyton Manning just tied Dan Marino with his 420th career TD pass.
DPI is the bane of the fantasy owners existence. Lloyd misses a TD on interference. Ridley closes it out.
Antonio Gates' roll continues. Scores another TD to put SD ahead.
Why is it that Chris Ivory didn't play most of the 1st half of the season? Spectacular 56-yard TD run. Showed everything you want from RB.
Greg Olsen just the latest tight end to score against the Broncos. It's a matchup to watch every week.
TD by Kendall Wright puts the Titans up in Miami.
The Bengals doing a great job defending their home turf agains the Giants. 2 TD edge on the Giants on Hawkins TD.

@BrendanHecht But both with good matchups. No problem if u want to use CJ.

@Boomerseven Miller and Nicks.
@BrendanHecht Don;t hate him but like others more. Dolphins good vs. run.
@RWFlintstone Stafford
@jpcookinass Neither bad. Smith safer.
@BrendanHecht Redman and Spiller
@DBuettner23 Bears too good to sit.
@wcf8089 Britt.
Percy Harvin, Aaron Hernandez, Darren McFadden, Mike Goodson, Darren Sproles all INACTIVE
@Naxx_23 PPR go with Amendola.
@PeteBecks Both have plenty of upside. I'd lean towards Ivory in a high-scoring game.
@mbgoldy Young and Boldin.
@thesplosion Use the starters-Bradshaw/Bush/Fred.
@SKaplan13 Leshoure
@MichaelJHoff Joique has been better and will be involved. Give it a shot.
@kevbo14 emergency
@kevbo14 Not a great one but in an emercency...
@ianralston13 Obviously love both but Brees is better this week.
@DylanKurtz12 Leshoure
@JoeMacofKC (and I am using them)
@JoeMacofKC I'd use Hartline and Redman.
@JerryPickles I'd start Pettigrew or have Casey/G.Graham/Heath Miller ready to go in Daniels place.
@ausomeAO Welker manhandles the Bills averaging over 100 yards/10 rec over last 3.
@MNsportsfan24 Turner and Sanders.
@timreid365 Greene and Young.
@charliehad Stevie
@deafjeffm Floyd and FJax
@jorge_delacruz8 White eats up the Saints. Go Roddy.
@Elias_McNees Both solid today but I like Britt with Locker back.
@sf_game Tate. Coming on strong. Bess if PPR.
@ausomeAO Jeez. All 3 are must starts. Flip a three sided coin.
@dmillz14 Sanders by a little.
@sirsharkey Bennett.  Redman and Greene.
@pete4k1 Freeman. Cam has been awful more than not and not seeing too many signs of turning it around vs. good Den D.
@RealWilliamCarr Sanders with Antonio Brown out.
@chris_campagna Still not ready to anoint Tannehill a starter so Vick.
@PTP819 Rice. Daniels iffy to play and game is tonight so we won't know for sure for a while.
@RaulCamarena BJGE
@huhl23 Wow. Pittsburgh's the only D I like better than Chicago this week based mainily on KC ineptitude.
@btaylor1978 Miami gives up a ton through the air. I'd give Britt the edge although not shying away from Greene this week.
@wilkentj Giants: Bennett, Cruz, Nicks should be back to normal at Cincinnati.
@HoganMike Have to play the Bears. Dominant fantasy defense should be matchup-proof.
@montysu Wonderful problem. I'd have to use Ryan. Try to trade one for a big RB/WR if you can.
@chris_campagna Lloyd and Leshoure.
@HeatherrGlass Patriots. They'll get some takeaways v. Buffalo.
@npuccine Time for Hail Mary trades/moves and start planning for next year.
@bugler54 Minnesota. Detroit is more mistake prone.
@hollywoodheffne Reece. Daniels is a gametime decision and you can't risk him not playing.
@HeatherrGlass Eli has the better matchup and responds well to the pressure of last two week's struggles. Texans could neutralize Cutler
