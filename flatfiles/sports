Congratulations to 2012 Sprint Cup Champion Brad @Keselowski
Bill Belichick's defense is feasting on Andrew Luck in today's blowout. Second pick-six of the day.
@PTP819 You're a Cowboys fan, right? Close call today.
Chris Ivory came close to breaking another one. A 25-yard run wasn't bad in any case.
@PTP819 Ha! Yes Schaub was incredible but nobody thought the Jags would stay in the contest. Freeman wasn't awful (3 TDs)
Give one back. The officials overturn the last fumble by Rod Streater.
The Saints defense is on a takeaway mission today. Three turnovers by the Raiders.
In his first game for a new team Aqib Talib pays instant dividends for the Patriots on a 59-yard TD return of an Andrew Luck interception.
@TerrazasManny 7 runs for 55 yards.
Andre Johnson ends up with 273 yards including the game-winning 48-yard overtime game winning TD.
Dan Bailey's 38-yard FG gives Dallas a 23-20 OT win over Cleveland.
Bucs complete the stunning comeback on a Freeman to Dallas Clark TD in OT.
Freeman and Jackson convert the 2-point play. Tie game likely headed for OT.
A bullet throw from Josh Freeman to Vincent Jackson for a 24-yrd TD puts the Bucs a 2-pt try from a tie in Carolina.
Entering today only Troy Aikman (15) had more 4th Q comebacks for the Cowboys than Tony Romo (14). Next Roger Staubach (13) Danny White (11)
Touchdown Benjamin Watson from Brandon Weeden to give the Browns the lead and quiet the Jerrydome. Still 1:07 to go
Matt Ryan now has thrown FIVE interceptions.
The answer: The only other Jaguar to throw 4 TDs against the Texans was Quinn Gray on Dec. 30, 2007. That game was also in Houston.
Great catch by Randall Cobb to adjust to the ball in the end zone between two defenders for a 22-yard TD grab.
@Awade21 That's the one.
Hint: the answer to the Jaguars 4 TD Q is NOT Steve Buerlein, Mark Brunell, Byron Leftwich or David Garrard.
Chad Henne is the second #Jaguars QB to throw for 4 TDs against Houston. Who was the first?
Romo to Dez Bryant puts the Cowboys ahead of Cleveland.
Ok, who had Chad Henne with four TDs and Matt Ryan with four INTs today? #OppositeDay
Bilal Powell scores his second rushing TD of the quarter for the Jets. Shonn Greene owners beware.
Megatron with leap, a score, and a stuff over the goalpost.

@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino McGahee
Cecil Shorts strikes again. 67-yard score from Henne.
Captain Munnerlyn with a 74-yard pick six of Josh Freeman. Still 10-7 Tampa Bay.
Aaron Rodgers to Jermichael Finley. TD Packers.
Two QBs have thrown three 1st Q INTs in past 4 years: Peyton Manning 9/17/12 vs Atlanta and Matt Ryan today for Atlanta.
Dalton to AJ Green gives the Bengals the lead. Only the Ravens on opening day have kept Green out of the end zone this year. #AllPro
@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino There's a long way to go.
@DrSamMorris scored in OT.
Nick Foles is having a tough starting debut so far. Two picks in the 1st Q.
In what's become routine Chad Henne replaces an injured Blaine Gabbert for the Jags in Houston.
After not holding a lead all season, KC grabs an advantage for the second week in a row. KC 3, Cin 0.
LaRod Stephens-Howling scores the 10th rushing TD of the season against the Falcons. Cards take the early lead.
@JTWarmoth7 Jones.
@Semery10 None are good choices but roll with Brown.
Send your #fantasyfootball questions/comments to @SI_DavidSabino throughout the week and here on Sunday pre-kickoff for lineup help.
@HazelAcev Freeman. Been outstanding recently.
@Semery10 Sproles should play. I like him better than DWill. TB very tough vs. run.
@bhayden21 Tough spot. Smith and cross fingers Flacco can get it to him.
Colts play at the Patriots today.  Including playoffs Tom Brady has topped 300 pass yards once in 8 career games vs. Indy at Foxboro ('04)
@Boomerseven No. I like Turner more for touchdown potential.
@LynnKupfer I'd go with James Jones but the other two should have good days too.
@mgugs46 Have to figure Cooper and Foles have worked a lot together in practice. Not a bad play over Shorts.
@margolin23 I like James Jones today vs. Detroit. The Pack should be fresh after a week off.
@LynnKupfer All are great but Mike Williams is the safest bet with Jones ailing.
Greg Jennings, Kevin Kolb, Joe Haden, DeMarco Murray, Mike Vick, Jason Avant, Andrew Hawkins all inactive for today's early games.
@margolin23 I like Alexander vs. the Broncos.
@deafjeffm  Garcon for Roberts is interesting. I'd probably do that.
@LynnKupfer @SI_DavidSabino I'd use Rivers who will find Gates a lot. Foles has a good matchup but no idea how he'll handle his 1st start.
@HazelAcev Both have major questions. I'd use Jones and hope he can gut it out the entire game.
@vtgoad I'd use Young. GB backs have been a major disappointment since Benson went down.
@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino @Playoffs You too. Let's get that 5-5 team a little better.
@vtgoad I'd use Romo.
RT @ChrisBurke_SI: Pierre Garcon, Julio Jones ready to go: NFL Week 11 key actives/inactives http://t.co/JsiO6pqD

@TerrazasManny Jones playing but could be limited. Mathews also iffy. I'f you have strong alternatives use them.
@pkeithb81 I like Bradford but Foles has a good matchup. Question is can he handle it? Not sure.
@PTP819 I'd go with Freeman and Witten.
@wilkentj Davis invisible recently and Bears tougher vs. TE. Vereen strictly a complementary player.
@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino Austin.

Bills win. Send your fantasy Qs to @SI_DavidSabino throughout the wek or here on Sunday AMs.
Davone Bess gets his first TD of the year. Amazingly Miami i now down just five points 19-14.
Knicks remain undefeated, go to San Antonio and beat the Spurs 104-100.
Reggie Bush thru the first 5 games: 417 rushing yards. Over the last 4.5 games: 138 rushing yards including net zero on 7 carries tonight.
Dolphins 50 net yards of offense, 0-5 on third down, allowed four first downs on penalties.
For the Dolphins to have played so poorly yet be just 12 down at the half is astounding. Buffalo 19-7.
Classic alligator arms for Tashard Choice on that last pass.
Time of possession: Buffalo 10:18; Miami 3:59.
96-yard kickoff return by Marcus Thigpen. TD Miami. 10-7 Bills. It's all special teams.
79 Yard punt return for Leodis McKelvin. Buffalo 7-0.
@BreakdownSheets you got it.
@jwjunker Correct
Bonus question: Before Miggy and JV who were the last pair of Detroit Tigers to win back-to-back MVPs?
@McFleet711 Admiration and a feeling of satisfaction.
The last AL team before the Tigers to have different MVPs in back to back seasons was the Rangers: Juan Gonzalez '98, Pudge Rodriguez '99
@REALGeoNio Nope
@peters_dylan Right
@dkuhn119 They did it in NL. Who did in AL?
@purdmanJR Correct.
@Curtos07 Yes
@WAF2004 Got it.
Miguel Cabrera followed Justin Verlander as #MVP #Tigers. What was the last AL team to have consecutive MVPs won by different players?
@deafjeffm Yes. Better than Allen.
Miami opponents average 42.0 pass attempts/game. If it remains that high It'll be the most against any AFL or NFL team in history.
The temp is in the low 30s for tonight's game. Miami's record in the last six sub-40-degree games at Buffalo: 3-3.
@BMoreRaven33 @SI_DavidSabino No forgetting that. But the Jets are a mess on offense. I'd stick with Boldin despite the tough matchup.
It's confirmed that Fred Jackson is inactive for tonight's Bills-Dolphins game making C.J. Spiller a great fantasy start.

Peyton Manning just tied Dan Marino with his 420th career TD pass.
DPI is the bane of the fantasy owners existence. Lloyd misses a TD on interference. Ridley closes it out.
Antonio Gates' roll continues. Scores another TD to put SD ahead.
Why is it that Chris Ivory didn't play most of the 1st half of the season? Spectacular 56-yard TD run. Showed everything you want from RB.
Greg Olsen just the latest tight end to score against the Broncos. It's a matchup to watch every week.

@RWFlintstone Stafford
@jpcookinass Neither bad. Smith safer.

@DBuettner23 Bears too good to sit.
@wcf8089 Britt.
Percy Harvin, Aaron Hernandez, Darren McFadden, Mike Goodson, Darren Sproles all INACTIVE
@Naxx_23 PPR go with Amendola.
@PeteBecks Both have plenty of upside. I'd lean towards Ivory in a high-scoring game.
@mbgoldy Young and Boldin.
@thesplosion Use the starters-Bradshaw/Bush/Fred.

@MichaelJHoff Joique has been better and will be involved. Give it a shot.

@ianralston13 Obviously love both but Brees is better this week.
@DylanKurtz12 Leshoure
@JoeMacofKC (and I am using them)
@JoeMacofKC I'd use Hartline and Redman.
@JerryPickles I'd start Pettigrew or have Casey/G.Graham/Heath Miller ready to go in Daniels place.

@MNsportsfan24 Turner and Sanders.
@timreid365 Greene and Young.

@RaulCamarena BJGE
@huhl23 Wow. Pittsburgh's the only D I like better than Chicago this week based mainily on KC ineptitude.
@btaylor1978 Miami gives up a ton through the air. I'd give Britt the edge although not shying away from Greene this week.
@wilkentj Giants: Bennett, Cruz, Nicks should be back to normal at Cincinnati.
@HoganMike Have to play the Bears. Dominant fantasy defense should be matchup-proof.
@montysu Wonderful problem. I'd have to use Ryan. Try to trade one for a big RB/WR if you can.
@chris_campagna Lloyd and Leshoure.
@HeatherrGlass Patriots. They'll get some takeaways v. Buffalo.
@npuccine Time for Hail Mary trades/moves and start planning for next year.
@bugler54 Minnesota. Detroit is more mistake prone.
@hollywoodheffne Reece. Daniels is a gametime decision and you can't risk him not playing.
@HeatherrGlass Eli has the better matchup and responds well to the pressure of last two week's struggles. Texans could neutralize Cutler

Doug Martin runs into the end zone for a fourth time today. #gameofalifetime
@LynnKupfer @SI_DavidSabino Very glad it worked out for you.
Touchdown Isaac Redman to give the Steelers the lead. This is the third straight game a Pittsburgh RB has gone over 100-yards rushing.
RT @mattbean1: @SInow NYC folks sans TV (but with Internet) can catch tonight's games on @aereotv
Steelers gamble on a fake field goal flip and fail. Giants retain 20-17 lead.
@aka_MR_FANTASY Only 2 TDs
The five others were Adrian Peterson, Jerome Harrison, Corey Dillon, Shaun Alexander and Mike Anderson.
Only six players since 1960 had as many rushing yards and TDs in a game as Doug Martin has thus far today with a lot of time remaining.
Doug Martin is having one of the greatest rushing days for any rookie in NFL history-18 carries for 244 yards and three touchdowns.
Doug Martin has at least 100 yards from scrimmage in all four games since Tampa Bay's bye and has scored touchdowns in three straight.
Adrian Peterson's 144 1st half rushing yards is highest total of the season. Michael Turner has 172 last season on 1/1 against the Bucs.
Big Ben takes the early advantage over Eli on a scoring toss to Emmanuel Sanders. 7-0 Steelers.
Vincent Jackson to the Bucs was among the most underrated signings of '12. Josh Freeman has excelled since his arrival; Chargers miss him.
The more experienced QB (including Luck over ex-WR Tannehill) has won every game so far in Week 9 with one exception: Cutler over Hasselbeck
Russell Wilson rolls right and hits Sidney Rice for the go-ahead score. Wilson has two TD passes and his receivers have three drops.
@bro2baseball McCoy
Andrew Luck's 433 passing yards today are one more than Cam Newton's rookie single-game record of 432 set last season against GB.
Send your #fantasyfootball questions to our roundtable here or to @SI_DavidSabino. #SIFantasyRoundtable
CJ2K has already been the leading rusher in two weeks (4 & 7) this season. Nobody else has done that more than once.
Chris Johnson's 80-yard TD makes him the day's top rusher and proves yet again that there is no garbage time in #fantasyfootball
Ravens 22, Phil Dawson 15.
This is the 3rd time the #ChicagoBears have scored 40+ pts. this season. The last year Chicago had at least 4 such games? 1948.
Tom Crabtree on a 72-yd TD pass from Rodgers. Has same no. of TD catches (3) as Jermichael Finley-Brandon Pettigrew-Jason Witten combined
Phil Dawson 15, Ravens 14
Touchdown Joel Dreessen gives the Broncos the lead back. It's Dreessen's fourth TD of the season tying him for 5th place among TEs.
Micheal Spurlock's TD in Jacksonville leaves the Jets as the only team to be shutout this season (week 4 vs. 49ers)
Andrew Luck has 273 passing yards in the first half. Peyton Manning only had three first halves with more yardage during his Indy career.
A tremendous catch by James Jones for his eighth TD this season.
The only Lion with four rushing TDs in a game? Of course it was Barry Sanders vs. Minnesota in 1991.
Leshoure with his 3rd TD of the day. The last Lion to run for 3 TDs in a game was James Stewart vs. TB in 2000.
Steve Smith is off the schneid. TD Panthers.
@matt_hartley_ Good one. #rouge?
Robbie Gould's FG is the 5th way the Bears have scored. Need a safety, fumble recovery, kick, punt and missed FG returns to finish set.
The Panthers keep RG3 out of the end zone on fourth and goal. #goallinestand
Mikel Leshoure with his second short TD run of the day. Lions 14-0.
@studmane Chargers 9 was in the AFL.
Demaryius Thomas is back in the game for Denver. #closecall #whew
Brian Urlacher scores the #ChicagoBears 7th touchdown on an interception return this season, one shy of Seattle's NFL mark.
Uh oh. Demaryius Thomas appeared to hurt his right foot on a long completion from Peyton Manning.
Matt Forte gets pushed into the end zone by his offensive linemen for an 8-yard  TD run.
Owen Daniels easily gets behind the Bills defense and Matt Schaub hits him for a TD.
DeAngelo Williams gets his 3rd TD of the season, in the process baffling the officials who originally appeared to rule him out of bounds.
Baltimore's Bernard Pierce scores his first NFL touchdown giving the Ravens a 14-0 lead in Cleveland.
Touchdown Andrew Luck to the ageless Reggie Wayne.
Not to be outdone by the defense, the #ChicagoBears special teams block a punt and return for a TD.
Ray Rice eludes the Browns defense for his 6th rushing TD of the season.
Send your #fantasyfootball Qs to our roundtable here or  to @SI_DavidSabino.

@twixrho9 Eli.
@BrendanHecht Wayne, Stew, Redman.
@yukon_10 With those choices you can afford to be conservative and sit Jordy.

@davierich I'd still use Megatron.
@cdunn808 Young is safer but reports on Johnson were good. Either way Jax secondary is banged up.
@LynnKupfer @SI_DavidSabino Redman, LRSH, Ballard
@davisjuggernaut Jackson vs. Saints is a very appealing matchup.
@vtgoad Redman turned into a PPR monster in his last action. I'd stick with him.
@BrendanMohlerGW I still like Jones.
@MNsportsfan24 Wouldn't play if he couldn't contribute. I'd use JOrdy.
@yvoids18 Jackson should play too.
@wcf8089 I like him but no. Gotta stick with your studs.

Chargers 31 Chiefs 13 Final.
Welcome to Football Follies, Chiefs edition.
Shaun Draughn just tied Jamaal Charles for the Chiefs rushing TD lead with 2. Matt Cassel has the only other TD run for KC all season.
The Chargers defense scores its 2nd straight TD. When it rains it pours for the Chiefs who have yet to hold a regulation lead this season.
There have been 33 passes and 33 runs so far between the Chargers and Chiefs after that Charles burst.
Over #kcchiefs last seven quarters Jamaal Charles has 13 rushing yards on 11 carries. #whatsgoingonwithplaycalling
Chargers go up 10-0 on a Nick Novak FG.

Third TD of the Year for Antonio Gates. He hasn't had fewer than seven since his rookie season.
Very impressive pre-game festivities in San Diego featuring U.S. service men, women and treasure. #flyover #patriotic
The last 100-yard rushing games for SD vs. KC were LaDainian Tomlinson's twice in 2007, two of 22 such games for SD vs. KC.
The last Chief to rush for 100 yards in a game against SD was Larry Johnson in 2006. Has only happened 15 times.
The #KCChiefs are 52-51-1 against the #Chargers alltime including the AFL and 42-42 since both joined the NFL.

If Dez Bryant's fingertip had hit an inch inside the white paint he would've been the hero and Romo would've been hailed as clutch. #cruel
@seshen Longest 10 seconds ever.
The NFL is a league of inches. Dez Bryant's hand was out of bounds. 6 seconds to go for Dallas trailing NYG by 5. 3rd & 6.
The play is under review.
OAK closed out KC 26-16 sending KC to a 6th defeat, 4th at home. As NFL RedZone pointed out, KC has not led any game. only W was on OT kick.
@TerrazasManny  Not that I know. They've just gone away from him in favor of passes to McCluster. Bizarre.
24 unanswered points. Romo to John Phillips TD erases the Giants lead and the XP puts Dallas in front for the first time today. 24-23.
@AlbanyHDTV I still have Demaryius Thomas to go so it's not over yet.
@BMoreRaven33 @SI_DavidSabino No consistency at all. Has talent but team is one-dimensional. Flex vs. easy opponents only.
Send your fantasy questions to our fantasy roundtable @SI_DavidSabino for a chance to have it answered in an upcoming column.
JPP for the Pick 6 TD. Giants 23 Cowboys 0.
@49ersForTheWin Willis, Bowman. There are plenty. Comment was pro-Jennings, not anti anyone else.
Plenty of good candidates for DPOY. Watt is leader. Jennings (6 picks) now also in the discussion  (w/Matthews, Tillman, etc.).
Tim Jennings joined JJ Watt squarely in the race for NFL defensive player of the year.
Zach Miller's first Seahawks TD silences Ford Field.
If the Packers can't hold on against the Jags at Lambeau it will be as bad if not worse than the "referee" loss in Seattle.
Dolphins defense and special teams have dominated the Jets. MIA hasn't beaten NYJ by >7 pts. in NJ since 2003, �14 since 1990.
And Megatron makes a catch...ties Whimper, Michael Hoomanawanui and Ben Hartsock for the day.
Guy Whimper has more receptions than Calvin Johnson today.
@BMoreRaven33 In an already suspect passing game he's dropped way behind Josh Gordon. Can't see a scenario I would confidently use him in.
Tremendous play by the Titans special teams on a blocked kick at the end of the first half in Nashville.
TD Louis Murphy,  just the way the Panthers drew it up.
The Panthers D looked like they were playing flag football on that Matt Forte scoring run.
Chris Givens 50-yard TD from Sam Bradford gives Rams a 7-0 lead over NE.

Re: Giants HR Q: It's last in the ENTIRE MAJOR LEAGUES.
@MikeinMillstadt The first guess is right.
The #KCChiefs gain 5.6 yards per first-down carry, best in the NFL. The #Steelers are last with 2.94 yards per first-down run.
#SFGiants are one game from winning the World Series. They finished last in '12 HRs with 103. What 3 teams were last in HR but won Series?
@AlbanyHDTV Not a big deal. I have plenty of depth.
@Nateburch63 I prefer Bradshaw.
@BMoreRaven33 @SI_DavidSabino Crabtree but both need an upgrade at this point.
@seth_shap Ben for both.

@d_browning18 See what Brown can do for you.
Maurice Jones-Drew, Jordy Nelson, Rashard Mendenhall, Isaac Redman, Danny Amendola all INCATIVE today.
@seth_shap Brown is expected to play so he's the better of iffy choices.
@jageneta Only way to play it safe is Keller but if you can get one of the Broncos/Cards TEs of David Thomas you can gamble on Graham.

Sergio Romo closes out a Bumgarner win as the #SFGiants head back to Detroit leading the #WorldSeries two games to none.
Jared Allen is a man possessed right now.
RT if you think Percy Harvin is the most exciting player in the #NFL. #VikingsFootball
Adrian Peterson breaks off a 64-yard touchdown run off the right side. He now has 122 yards on the day.
Martin is the first player to run for over 100 yards in the 1st half against Minnesota since Shaun Alexander in 2002.
If you didn't know about Doug Martin before, you will now. 64-yard TD reception and run.
Freeney forced 43 fumbles but only recovered three in his career. The active leader in recoveries of opposition fumbles: Ray Lewis (19)
Doug Martin has 106 rushing yards on 14 carries in the first half. 20-10 TB
@jacobga12 you got it!
The correct answer is Dwight Freeney who has forced 43 fumbles in his 11 NFL seasons. John Abraham is next with 41 fumbles forced.
@AWilensky24 Correct!
@SeanMJohnson Second.
Nobody mentioned Julius Peppers who is fourth. Or Robert Mathis in third.
Lots of Ray Lewis guesses. He's tied for 16th with 19.
@JimmyOldham23 correct!
Nobody has it yet. Most forced fumbles among active NFL players.
Since the start of '10 Mike Williams has more TD catches (18) than Larry Fitzgerald (17). tied for 14th w/ Welker, L. Moore, Austin, Maclin.
That was Ronde Barber's 16th career forced fumble. Who has the most among active players?
Josh Freeman may want to roll away from Brian Robison's side (3 knocked down passes).
Touchdown Ponder to Percy Harvin and just like that the Vikings are back in the game.
TD Freeman to Erik Lorig. 10-0 Tampa Bay.
Minnesota's offense has gained 16 yards on its first three possessions. Adrian Peterson has 17 rushing yards. Not a typo.
Bucs take a 3-0 lead on the Vikes in a game that if it keeps going like this will send many viewers over to the #WorldSeries.

One hour until the Cardinals and Giants face off in Game 6 of the NLCS. Will the series end tonight or go the distance?
That's two touchdowns from Brady to Gronkowski today. This one was much easier than the first. NE 23-13.
Good effort by Denarius Moore to reach into the end zone. TD Raiders.
MJD in street clothes and on crutches along the Jaguars sideline. Left foot injury, severity TBD.
The Raiders offense is no way devoid of talent, in fact it's quite the opposite, but when they line up as a unit it's hard to tell.

@mgugs46 I'd keep him in there. Roethlisberger's grumblings plus Bengals secondary should = good game for Brown.
@TYinUTAH @SI_DavidSabino TY Hilton.
@deafjeffm I'd sit Ballard.
@BurgerisaKeeper @SI_DavidSabino Felix.
@damiansmith0812 Cook. Finley has fallen off badly of late.
@EricMason4 RG3 because of his running.
@mgugs46 Blount-Hardesty. Woodhead decent since Pats RBs are thin today and vs old team but I like the others better.
@LynnKupfer Martin/Ridley
@DS_213 Very hard to trust. I'd look elsewhere.
@nastaiger Felix
@parfornick Colston.
@Kastman4 Wright, Morris and Greene.
@paydawg @SI_DavidSabino Denver's off so Tamme's out. Maybe Keller makes an appearance on the stats sheet.
@coachruda I like Martin and Washington.
@philipleone @SI_DavidSabino I don't trust Dwyer. Has done nothing all year. Was healthy scratch last week. If PPR can use Peerman
@qbkilla76 RG3 based on running ability.
@bugler54 @SI_DavidSabino Kickers are a crapshoot but I'd go with Nugent.
@wilkentj Should have easier time this week not having to concentrate solely on pass-blocking
@SportsIsLife_23 He's been great but I'd have to sit Rudy.
@BarelyRegal Ben and Gordon.
@Mgodsey2011 Peerman coming off of great game and BJGE disappointing. It's a gamble but PPR gives Peerman the edge.
@dwmiller1412 Fitz and Cobb
@WillSmiththe2nd Yes. He's running well and the team is phasing out SJax.
@mgugs46 I like both Tanner and Blount this week better than Woodhead.
@AdamWeigle No reason he shouldn't. In light of Big Ben's recent comments I'd look for more deep shots for he and Wallace.
@WestonWilcoxon @SI_DavidSabino Yes. Leading the league in yards per carry.
@McBeth88 I'd sit Bush.
@Chest_Rockwell7 Good luck.
@KGsDADDY11 @SI_DavidSabino Gordon
@Zach_Anderson40 Bradshaw.
@MarkyMark2_0 @SI_DavidSabino I don't trust DHB yet. Ogletree ready to break out again. I like Gordon too but go with DAL
@bugler54 @SI_DavidSabino I'd sit Green
@trainwreck00 Such a tough call. I'd have to side with Romo based on the defenses but always risky.
@BurgerisaKeeper @SI_DavidSabino Felix
@Chest_Rockwell7 I prefer Moore.
@wuratm Williams is on a roll and I'd use him in a favorable matchup.
@philipleone @SI_DavidSabino @EricMackFantasy Batch and Allen.
@jmoralez714 @SI_DavidSabino Sorry. Fred.
@somoge17 Luck at home vs. Cleveland.
@SmeeginLegan Greene and Dalton.
@DS_213 Cobb's a solid play today.
@LeeBremer I'd use Brown who should get some touches when Bradshaw needs a breather.
@BornNbredSooner Gordon.
@sirsharkey Ballard and Dwyer have shown nothing. I'd use Bennett.
@drjem5 @SI_DavidSabino RG3 has answered every challenge so far and his running puts him a hair ahead.
@LynnKupfer I'd sit DeA and use Richardson and Tate.
@a_kowalsky @SI_DavidSabino The two Giants are the safest picks. The Redskins give up a lot of points.
@WestonWilcoxon @SI_DavidSabino CJ too streaky. I'd use Spiller.
@Boomerseven @SI_DavidSabino I'd sit Leshoure vs. the very tough Bears.
@wcf8089 Ridley is a solid play anyhow especially vs. Jets and with Bolden out.
@jmoralez714 @SI_DavidSabino I'd go with Jackson given those choices.
@a_kowalsky @SI_DavidSabino Solid depth there. I'd use Bradshaw.
@WillSmiththe2nd Depends on who's available.
@mgugs46 I like Hernandez and would sit Tate.
@TerrazasManny Yes. Bradshaw will start according to multiple reports.
@wilkentj Dez. Smith slumping pre-bye and Pokes DBs are tough.

@yvoids18 What are some options?
Oregon 8, Arizona State 7 with just 1:12 gone in the first quarter.
That's two crucial drops by the Seahawks, Turbin and Moore. Good throws by Wilson on both.
Kendall Hunter entered tonight's game as the third-leading rusher in terms of yards per carry, behind only C.J. Spiller and RGIII.
This is the first time since 1948 that the Yankees won't win the World Series in a year the Kentucky Wildcats won the NCAA basketball title.

@marino74 1 for 2 with 2 BB
Tigers 3, Yankees 0. Tigers lead ALCS 2-0.
Redskins rookie backfield has combined for 918 rushing yards and 11 TDs this season. #nomoreshanahanigans
Tom Brady's 58 attempts were a career-high but fourth most in Pats history. Drew Bledsoe (70, 60) and Steve Grogan (59) had more.
If the Bills can pull out this game in the desert the entire AFC East would be 3-3.
The Seahawks stop Brady, Welker and the Patriots on 4th down and take over with 53 seconds left. Seattle 24, New England 23. #12thman
Seahawks have the Patriots on the ropes with 1:14 remaining. The 12th man in full effect.
RG3 has 139 yards rushing and two TDs today following his 76-yard scamper. His 182 passing yards with a TD/INT seem like an afterthought.
Jay Feely kicks a 61-yard FG to tie the Bills at 16. That's right, a 61-yard FG from Jay Feely. #kickersdialinglongdistance

And with minimum 5 NFL games played it's Victor Cruz who started today with an 82.3 ypg average.
It's today's leading (well, tied) receiver Calvin Johnson with 79.4 yards per game. For those with over 100 games played it's Andre Johnson.
@DavidBassily Correct. If it's 100 games its someone else.
@bgilmer80 Yes if qualifier is over 100 games. Not if it's lower.
@A_Garry Nope
@kobie173 say 50.
Did I mention it's not Jerry Rice?
In his 14th season Randy Moss just became the 4th player with 15,000 receiving yards. He ranks 11th in receiving yards per game. Who's 1st?
Redskins Madieu Williams picks off Ponder, zig-zags his way to the pylon for a 24-yard TD.
Tigers take a 1-0 lead on a fielder's choice grounder by Delmon Young that Robinson Cano failed to turn the double play on.
RG3 joins Alfred Morris as rookies with 5 rushing TDs this season.
@mrurbz NFL Films.
With so much pressure on him all the time Kevin Kolb is starting to look like Fran Tarkenton circa 1963.
In the ALCS  Thru 5 1/2 it's scoreless. Kuroda 1 hit allowed, 8 Ks, Sanchez  3 hits allowed, 5Ks.
TD Alfred Morris, his 5th of the year.
Through 6g Greg Zuerlein has tried six 50+yard FGs, made 4. The most 50+ attempts in a season is 11 (3x) and makes is 8 (Morten Andersen)
Jason Hanson's kick gives the Lions a second win.
Tony Scheffler has come up big late in this one. Two huge catches.
Lions ball at midfield after Stefan Logan fumbles then recovers the punt return.
Lions D-Line not looking overrated on those last two plays.
Lions and Eagles tied at 23 with 3 ticks to go.
Dangerous plays by the Lions.
Hasn't Calvin Johnson been involved in more close and controversial plays the past few years than any other receiver?
Great 46-yard catch and run for Brady to Wes Welker TD.

Dan Bailey's 51-yard FG goes wide left. Ravens survive.
Dallas is alive: Recovered onside kick.
Pass hits Bryant in the chest and goes incomplete. Ravens up 2 with 32 seconds to go.
Romo to Dez Bryant leaves Cowboys 2-pt conversion shy of a tie.
@SwampJankins He's going to make one like that one of these days.
@ConroyDonkong first 3 correct...last two, not.
Miami wins as Zuerlein's 66-yard FG try goes wide left.
If Zuerlein makes this one...
one-armed circus catch by Brandon Gibson in crunch-time down three against Miami.
The #Falcons remain NFC's only undefeated team. 6-0. AFC's undefeated team the #Texans coming up tonight.
@AlbanyHDTV Yup. No targets. No reports of injury.
Move from SD to TB has been no problem. This is the 1st time Vincent Jackson has 4 receiving TDs through his team's first 5 games.
Asante Samuel's 79-yard Pick-6 was his 47th career INT breaking a tie with Ronde Barber who earlier had a 78-yard pick 6 for his 46th INT
@TerrazasManny No reports of an injury.
After review, the pee wee play resulted in a KC touchdown after all.
Today's is just the second 3-INT game of Matt Ryan's 70-game career (including the playoffs).
@mham91 Research pays off.
A Chiefs punt block just turned turned int a pee wee football play. 1st and goal on the 1 for the Chiefs.
@Rogan_OReilly Not LT...only dd it once for Gang Green
@MikeH1123 3 for 5...not your 1st or fifth
@rgbrownie Got two, and two, and two...
@B_R_West yup. Top guy with 8
@DMinformation Top guy with 8
@rockmole Got one.
Shonn Greene is the 6th Jets rusher with multiple career 100-yard, 2 TD games. Can you name the other 5?
Redskins WR Pierre Garcon is INACTIVE today
Ronde Barber's 45th interception and 8th TD is the most bizarre. Ball popped up to him off of players laying on the ground. Ran 78 yards TD
Mike Williams became the first Bucs receiver with 100-yards in the first half since Antonio Bryant in 2008.
Bad day for DB:. Morris Claiborne and Lardarius Webb are both injured in the Ravens-Cowboys game.
And now the Lions have a pick too, Louis Delmas grams an errant Michael Vick throw.
Shonn Greene is making a statement: 11 carries, 63 yards 1 TD.
TB TD for Mike Williams from Josh Freeman and TD Mark Sanchez to Stephen Hill for the Jets.
Waivers alert: Rams WR Chris Givens already had 3 catches for 85 yards serving as Danny Amendola's replacement.
Matt Ryan and Tony Romo seem to be impersonating each other today.
Jermaine Gresham rambles into the end zone on a 55-yard completion from Andy Dalton for the first touchdown of the day.
Greg the Leg Zuerlein nails a 48-yard 'Chip Shot' to give the rams a lead over Miami.
Raiders Joselio Hanson picks off Matt Ryan for Oakland's first INT of the season. The only other team without one is DET (facing Vick).
Kickoffs about to begin. Good luck to all fantasy players.
When last they met: http://t.co/IOVNiADc
@paligap914 Thanks. Good luck.
@paligap914 Boldin but neither a great play.
@RaulCamarena Gibson is safer. Nicks bigger upside. I like upside.
@Mgodsey2011 @SI_DavidSabino Ballard will get the carries with the best matchup. He's who I'd use.
@FreshkidRuben Nicks? Won't know for sure for three hours or so but probably yes.
@Johnny__Brooks Anyone who reads my column knows I'm a big Morris supporter but I'd go with Richardson this week.
@yarden_a Limited practices and tough D. I wouldn't unless no other decent alternatives.
@DSoftheForce I'm expecting Martin to have a very good game. No idea how DHB will respond to first action back from concussion.
@Klutch15 @SI_DavidSabino Celek
@BerMA33 @SI_DavidSabino Not much time til 1PM kickoffs.
@Boomerseven @SI_DavidSabino I like Roberts this week. But then Meachem's schedule will probably make him the choice going forward.
@sjwalton425 @SI_DavidSabino Schaub
@BerMA33 @SI_DavidSabino Nicks the best of that bunch.
@SLAB783 Meachem
@BMoreRaven33 Vick

@gene_riley Torrey.
@MNsportsfan24 I'd use Vick in a big game.
@wilkentj Same reasoning. Bennett.
@BrendanMohlerGW This week: Crabtree
@LynnKupfer Miami if scoring means a lot. Cards if turnovers count more.
@sportsfan009 That's for sure but only 2 TD passes in last three games  isn't cutting it.
@StevenWDoty Maclin.
@DSoftheForce Roberts and .....hesitation...looks for alternatives....sees none...Leshoure.
@BrendanMohlerGW Rodgers although not in a walkover.
@wilkentj TDs vs. 49ers this year: WR: 1  TE: 4 Go with Bennett.
@wilkentj Brady.
Inactives: Matt Cassel, Donald Brown, Daniel Thomas.  
Darrius Heyward-Bey is active.
@deafjeffm Chandler
@HotRod9169 Buffalo has been giving up yards/points hand over fist. Gotta go with Kolb if (big if) he can get any protection.
@deafjeffm Both super risky but I like Powell better.
@wilkentj Better than Wilson.
@BrendanHecht Miami
Sanchez, Romo and Vick appear to be in the most trouble. Not a lot of Matthew Stafford mentions, surprisingly.
@wilkentj Not high on him.
@BrendanHecht Eagles.
@BrendanHecht Yup. Great Miami-Florida State matchup today.
@wcf8089 I'd stick with Jordy.
@JAdamCochran Vick's riskier but also much more likely to have more fantasy points.

Notre Dame is undefeated after two goal-line stands. Now, they should dream bigger than a random BCS bowl. http://t.co/gW4GoWnR
The game of the day in college football: Texas A&M 59, La Tech 57.
RT @joe_sheehan: The last Yankee postseason game in which Derek Jeter didn't play was October 8, 1995.
RT @richarddeitsch: Joe Girardi said he would not play A-Rod at short. "It's been too long."
Joe Girardi says Derek Jeter has a left ankle fracture. Jeter is out for the rest of the postseason.
Yankees gave them a scare, but the Tigers take #ALCS Game 1, 6-4. http://t.co/t05q3jft #MLB
Here he is again: Raul Ibanez at the plate w/ Ichiro on first base and two outs in Bottom 11. #ALCS
RT @SethDavisHoops: Just incredible. It's why we love sports.
What is better than October baseball? Raul Ibanez's 2-run shot ties Yankees-Tigers, 4-4 in the bottom of the 9th. #ALCS
Then again, South Carolina keeps it close. TD shrinks #LSU's lead to 23-21 w/ 1:41 left. Onside kick coming. #SCARvsLSU
That should do it for #LSU: Jeremy Hill's 50-yard run gives them a 23-14 lead over South Carolina w/ 5:03 left. #SCARvsLSU
Delmon Young...gone. His solo shot boosts Tigers' lead to 3-0 in Top 8. #ALCS
Bases loaded? Not a problem for Doug Fister. He gets out of a jam, and Tigers still lead 2-0 after 6 innings. #ALCS
#LSU gets the touchdown it was looking for, leading South Carolina 10-7 early in the 3rd quarter. #SCARvsLSU
RT @SIPeteThamel: Great note. Unless you are an LSU fan. LSU has 29 straight offensive possessions in SEC play without a touchdown.

Kyle Brindza's 22-yard field goal is good for Notre Dame. Irish & Cardinal tied 13-13 w/ 20 seconds left. http://t.co/Fhf4BAZ2
The real takeaway from Oklahoma's beatdown of Texas: Mike Stoops' return has made a big impact. http://t.co/g4bNiIxJ
File under "unexpected halftime scores": Texas Tech leads #WVU, 35-7. Red Raiders QB Seth Doege has 336 yds passing & 4 TDs.

#RL Jets defense pitches its 4th 3-and-out drive of the game on SEA's first series of 2nd half.
#RL Seahawks lead 14-7 at halftime and also lead in yards (134-112), 1st downs (8-5), possession (15:25-14:35). Teams tied in turnovers 2-2.
@artpilz We'll be looking to hold them here, Arturo. #LetsGoJets
#EA B. Powell slow to get up after that punt.  SEA has ball at their 43 with 1:19 on the clock.
#EA Call upheld.   Jets now trail 14-7.  2-Minute warning.  'Hawks will get the ball to start the 3rd.  Jets have 2 TOs and ball at own 21.
#RL Seattle leads 14-7. The 'Hawks' 7-point lead is their largest first-half lead over the Jets at home since 1979, a span of 6 games.
#EA Seattle takes the 13-7 lead as they capitalize after the turnover.  Lynch got in from 1-yard out.  They are reviewing the play though.
#RL Antonio Cromartie, who leads Jets in INTs (3), pass defenses (10), gets a big PD in end zone on Wilson fleaflicker pass to Sidney Rice.
#EA Now we're even in the turnover department as Jeremy Kerley can't field the punt.  SEA ball at the NYJ 42.
#RL Jets third 3-and-out series this game. Robert Malone's nifty drop punt forces Leon Washington to fair-catch it at SEA-10.
#EA Jets D in 1.5 quarters: 3 sacks, 2 takeaways, 1 TD.
#RL Ellis Lankster strip-sack of Russell Wilson was Lankster's first career sack. Jets have ball at midfield.
@JoshieichibaN That was a big stop, Josh. #LetsGoJets
#EA Wilson is rattled.  Lankster comes untouched and gets the strip-sack. Ricky Sapp almost had it, but the 'Hawks recovered.
@AliciaLavancox3 We appreciate all of the love, Alicia. #LetsGoJets
#RL Mark Sanchez tries to find Dustin Keller in EZ, throws his 4th red zone INT this season to CB Richard Sherman, who steps OB at SEA-2.

#RL Jeremy Kerley's 43-yd completion from Mark Sanchez to SEA-7 gives JK 4 catches for 55 yds today.
#EA That's Pace's 1 Fumble Recovery of the season and 10th of his career.
#RL Mo Wilkerson forces Marshawn Lynch FUM, Calvin Pace recovers. Seahawks have as many giveaways in this game (2) as in first 4 home games.
@BigShaq18 We appreciate the support, Shaquille. #LetsGoJets
#EA Fumble recovery by the Jets.  They got the ball out from Lynch.  That's 2 takeaways now.  Looks like C. Pace has it.
#RL Jets CB Isaiah Trufant has a knee injury. His return to this game is questionable.
#EA 7-7 at CenturyLink Field. 1st career TD for Mo Wilkerson.  That was Bart's first sack of the year on the last series.
#RL Mo Wilkerson 21-yd FUM-return TD off Mike DeVito stripsack ties it at 7. Jets' first defensive FR TD since Marques Douglas @ IND in 09.
#EA That's Wilson's 1st home turnover this year.  Mike Devito with the strip-sack and Wilkerson rumbles in from 21 yards out. We got a tie!

@JacquelynSpader Our game is being televised on CBS, Jackie. Check your local listings for details.
#EA Jets are going to continue to try to knock that ball loose from Marshawn Lynch.  Lankster got in there with some pressure on 3rd down.
#RL Leon Washington's first touch vs. his former team is a 20-yd punt return to SEA 40.
#RL Before that TD, Jets had scored first in 8 of the previous 9 games vs. Seahawks (7-2), and in the previous 5 games @ SEA (3-2)
@tfallo22 We can't hear that enough, Tara. #LetsGoJets
#RL Russell Wilson to WR Golden Tate for 38-yd TD over Kyle Wilson. SEA rookie has 10 TD passes (0 INTs) in 5 games at CenturyLink Field.
@RachelBarese Way to represent the #GreenAndWhite, Rachel.

@MrRatch That's right, Adam. #LetsGoJets

#EA That is tough.  McCourty ties it up from 104 yards out.  The Jets were the NFL's No. 1 unit covering kickoffs.  7-7 in a blink of an eye
#RL Jets' TD comes w/ 6:09 gone in opening quarter. It's Jets' first 1st-quarter lead @ NE in last 8 games, since THU night win here in '08.

@jyct_ We're still right in this game. #LetsGoJets
@Pika250 That's right, Philip. #LetsGoJets
@Rubzzz123 That was an electrifying play, Jeremy. #LetsGoJets

#EA AH that was FAST!  McKnight for 100 yards.  20-14.  Big lift from special teams.

@GUYRICHARDS1 Our guys will be fired up to get back out there after the half, Guy. #LetsGoJets
#RL Texans, who came in 4-0, have not trailed in the 2nd half in their 5 games so far this season.
#RL For 2nd straight week, Sanchez tipped INT before half results in opponents' FG. Texans lead 17-7 at half, lead in yards (246-166).
For a 2nd consecutive week, the Jets have a critical turnover in enemy territory before the half.  17-7 Texans.

#RL CB Brice McCain picks off tipped red zone pass, deflected by J.J. Watt, returns 86 yds to Jets 9. Bilal Powell pursuit prevents TD.
@_Ms_Megan That was a tough break, Megan, but we need to step it up and stop them here.
#EA Jets inside the Red Zone.  This drive started at the NYJ 7 - Hilliard's 15-yard gain after the fumble looms large.
#RL Sanchez-to-Jeremy Kerley 36-yd gain to HOU-27. RB Shonn Greene nice blitz pickup. Then Sanchez-to-Chaz Schilens for 10 to 17, Jets TO.

#RL Lex Hilliard continues to make plays in his Jets debut--recovers Sanchez strip sack, takes it 15 yds at 2-minute warning.
@Lick_My_SOUL We have confidence in our front office to put the guys on the field that give this team the best possible chance to win games.

@KarlSchif We believe in this team, Karl. #LetsGoJets
#RL Texans LB Brian Cushing (left knee) return to this game is questionable.
@B_gentle We just missed a big play there, Brent.

@oskrsanchez We can't hear that enough, Oscar. #LetsGoJets
#RL Tebow at QB 1st 2 plays this drive, first time he's had 2 plays in a row at QB on same drive for Jets. TT carries 3 yds, Bilal Powell 3.
@caprivc We appreciate the support, Valerie. #LetsGoJets
@tsatt44 We have confidence in our coaching staff to get the guys on the field that put this team the best possible position to win, Tyler.
#EA  Jets struggles against the run continue thus far.  Arian Foster: 7 carries - 93 yards.  Foster was 3 for 42 on that scoring march.

@DanielleCosmo We appreciate the support, Danielle. #LetsGoJets

#RL Fourth-and-2-inches at Jets 25. Tim Tebow, personal protector, makes it 2-for-2 on fake punt runs with 3-yard gain.
#EA Solid opening quarter from Mark Sanchez.  He was 4-of-6 for 69 yards and the 1 score.
@Joseph__Scott We'll be looking to pick up a big win here tonight, Joe. #LetsGoJets
@MikeJohnstonPT That was a well executed play on their part, Mike, but now we're just focused on stopping them here.
#RL That was the Jets' first first-quarter TD in six games all-time vs. Houston.
#RL Mark Sanchez to Jeff Cumberland, 27-yd TD. Only Jets' 2nd TD in last 37 drives since opening with TD @ PIT in Game 2.
@RichieNavarro3 That's right, RIchie. #LetsGoJets
#EA That's what you do with your takeaway � cash it in with points.  Hell of a toss from Sanchez to Cumby for 27 yards. Tied up at the Met.
@RealCoreyOs That was a great connection, Corey. #LetsGoJets
@EvelDick We're looking to make something happen here, Evel. #LetsGoJets
@tfallo22 That was a heads up play, Tara. #LetsGoJets

@RJWda3rd He made a great play on that ball, Rohan. #LetsGoJets
@Drego101 Antonio was all over that pass, Joe. #LetsGoJets

@beenrockjammin That was a tough break, Michelle, but now we're just focused on getting the ball back and making something happen.

#RL Robert Malone gets off 43-yd punt, 5.19-second hang time, Ted Ginn fair-catches at SF-32.
#EA Santonio Holmes is being carted off the field.  The left knee is the concern. 49ers now up 24-0, have 4 takeaways.
#RL Longest fumble-return TD by a NYJ opponent since CB Rashard Anderson went 94 yds in 2001 at CAR in "the Shrek Game," won by Jets 13-12.
#RL Carlos Rogers returns fumble by WR Santonio Holmes after catch 51 yds for TD to give SF a 24-0 lead with 14:46 to play...

#RL Jets go 3-and-out, their third such series of the game. 7 possessions: 4 punts, 3 giveaways.
#EA Uphill climb when you turn it over 3 times.  Akers misses from 40 yards after D holds and it�s still 10-0.  Will that be a spark?
#RL David Akers 40-yd FG attempt to open 3rd qtr goes wide right. He's now 5-for-10 career FG tries vs. Jets.
#RL Jets trail at the half in yardage (210-83), first downs (14-4), takeaways (2-0) and on the scoreboard.
#RL Akers 36-yd FG is good to end the half. Akers now career 5-for-9 on FG tries vs. Jets.
#RL Personal foul on SF's Aldon Smith after the play. First down Jets--their 11th first down by penalty this season--at SF 33.
#EA Good hold by the defense.  Jets have great field position at the SF 47.  Trailing 7-0 with 2:29 left before the half.
#RL Robert Malone's 3rd punt: 41-yd punt, 4.90-second hang time, Ted Ginn fair catch at SF 11.
#RL Sacks were the Jets' first in two games, Pace's first of the season, Thomas' first since 2010.
#RL Jets injuries: TE Dedrick Epps (knee), FB John Conner (hamstring), return to this game is questionable for both.
#RL Back-to-back sacks by Bryan Thomas and Calvin Pace forces SF to settle for 55-yd David Akers FG try, wide right. Jets ball at their 45.
#EA Back-to-back sacks.  BT and then C. Pace as the veteran OLBs step up here at the Met.
#EA SF lives off takeaways � were a plus 28 last year.  Niners take over after the fumble with great field position.  D needs a stand.
#RL Jets' 7-0 deficit is the first time in 6 quarters that they've trailed at home this season.
#RL Niners drive 68 yds to Colin Kaepernick 7-yd keeper TD. Kaepernick 2 carries, 24 yds, Jets run def has given up 104 yds on 12 carries.

@marykate_goff We can't let up yet Mary Kate.
@traynorBADGER07 Big touchdown, Matthew!
@brebabs @jonSCOTTathan Thanks for spreading the word, Breanne.
#RL WR Stephen Hill has a hamstring injury. His return to this game is questionable.
#RL Robert Malone 4.59-hang time on a drop punt that Isaiah Trufant catches at MIA 5-yd line. Jets still trail 17-13 with 7:13 left.
#RL Dan Carpenter misses from 48 yds out. That's Carpenter's first miss vs. Jets after going 13-for-13 from 2008 to present.
#EA Last 2 Red Zone trips for the Jets � 3 points.  But plenty of time left to win this thing.
#RL Jeremy Kerley 66-yd catch-n-run longest non-scoring reception by Jets WR since Neil ODonnell-to-Wayne Chrebet (70 yds, vs MIA, 1997).
#RL After 1st-and-goal at MIA 1, Jets settle for Nick Folk 20-yd FG (5-for-5 this season), now trail Dolphins 17-13, 13:29 left.
@IllestHenry You can find them here, Henry- http://t.co/Rnk1BV8N.
#RL Richard Marshall interferes with Santonio Holmes just over GL. For Holmes, that's 7 penalties forced against opposing DBs last 2 wks.
@Jnat675 That was a great 66-yd connection, Justin.
@Rubzzz123 Jeremy made a great run after the catch, Jeremy.
#EA Jets will have a chance to tie this one up when the 4th quarter commences.  That 66-yarder to Kerley was a monster play.
@Banks81 Great play, Dave.
#RL Dolphins 2nd 1-yd TD run of the day, this one by FB Jorvorskie Lane for his 1st NFL TD, puts MIA up 17-10.
#RL Darrelle Revis has a knee injury. He's out for remainder of this game.
#EA Very scary when you see Darrelle Revis down.  Hopefully No. 24 is OK.  Kyle Wilson takes over on the outside.   Revis being carted off.
#RL Dolphins starting on their own 20 after Robert Malone punt. MIA average field position last 7 drives: their own 14-yard line.
#RL Jets had 4 takeaways in their first 3 quarters this season, then none in their next 7 quarters, then 2 on consecutive plays today.
#EA Sanchez's 2nd INT of the day takes points off the board.  The Jets and Dolphins remained tied at 10.  Red Zone turnover is tough.
@Jenna_Nicolee Thanks for the support, Jenna!
@Deano_Jets88 2 big turnovers can turn the game around, Callum.
#EA Another turnover.  Wow.  Revis with the recovery.  Jets in business again.
@IRGrubsy Great way to start the 2nd half, Ian!
#RL Also it's Landry's first INT-return TD of his 6-year NFL career.
@DMaceranka All tied up.
#RL LaRon Landry picks off Ryan Tannehill, returns 18 yds for gametying TD. Second Jets INT-return TD this season (Cromartie vs. BUF).
#EA There is that turnover!  Landry pick-six!
#RL MIA RB Reggie Bush has a knee injury. His return to this game is questionable.
#EA Jets could really use a takeaway.  Dolphins have this 7-point lead and the TD followed a turnover.
@CBROWNDAGOD Pressuring the QB is a key to winning this game. We know we need to turn it up.
@d_nugent We know we need to play better to win this game, David.
#RL Dolphins lead in yardage (156-114), takeaways (1-0), Jets ahead in 1st downs (10-9), possession time (16:03-13:57).
#RL Jets trail Dolphins at half, 10-3. It's Dolphins' first halftime lead in their last nine home games against the Jets.
@dormaechea Thanks for rooting us on, David.
#RL Nick Folk, who opened last season with 11-for-11 on FG tries, is now 4-for-4 this season.
#RL Rookie WR Stephen Hill can't hold 3rd-down TD pass in end zone, Nick Folk comes on for 33-yd FG, cuts MIA lead to 10-3, 1:50 left 1H.
@ItsCanCan9 This has been a good-looking drive.
#EA Maybe the direct snap to Tebow for a 4th down conversion will get the Jets going.
#RL Personal punt protector Tim Tebow takes direct punt snap on 4th-and-3 at Jets 25, gets 5 yds for 1st down.
@therick4444 We know we need to turn it up to win this game, Rick.
#RL Dan Carpenter 21-yd FG gives Dolphins 10-0 lead, their largest lead over the Jets in the teams' last 7 games at Sun Life Staidum.
#EA Jets in a 10-0 hole after Dan Carpenter's 21-yard FG.

@FrostyFreeds When is it? I had one of my best games vs. Stony Brook in 99 (& didn't leave the field crying). Also nearly died on drive over

@tigerwilhite I read same stuff. But Gehrig winning Triple Crown & finishing 5th in voting raises questions to, right?
@bomani_jones Plus, Gehrig won Triple Crown in '34 & finished FIFTH in MVP! Lou Gehrig! Who hated him? So, I'm not all in with Ted hate.
.@bomani_jones and they did vote for him the 2 other years he won MVP. Did they "hate" him less then?
.@bomani_jones always been flummoxed by that. Media "hated" Ted-didn't win MVP either TripleCrown yr-but they did vote him 2nd those years

@Shit_shoveler Gehrig won the Triple Crown in 34 and was 5th in MVP voting. And history tells us people loved Lou.
@Dan_McCarthy92 And Gehrig in 34? Won Triple Crown and finished 5th in MVP.  Even if you're not buying Ted, you gotta buy Lou!
@picabyte Time didn't permitt me to also mention Lou Gehrig's Triple Crown season not winning MVP. So even if you're not buying Ted, buy Lou
@picabyte I'm not buying that, Cathy. He finished 2nd in voting both Triple Crown years & 1st in his two MVP seasons. People voted for him.
@Dan_McCarthy92 I'm not buying that. He finished 2nd in voting both Triple Crown years & 1st in his two MVP seasons. People voted for him.
@Shit_shoveler He finished 2nd each of those years.  And won the award twice, in other years. He was voted for, just not 1st.

@emoneybaby and astronomy&astrology were one in the same until centuries after Copernicus when astronomy became a science, so no correction
@CalebBlount of course, they've been most impressive/fortunate/best of 4-0s, there's no debate there, so we didn't ask that Q.
@emoneybaby @PTI I'll play your game, hehe-you wanted me to say Copernicus wasn't 5000 yrs ago/wasn't astrologer. 5000 was an exaggeration
@CalebBlount Bottom line: The Q wasn't Who's Better:Falcons or Cardinals? It was, 'Who's more Fortunate to be 4-0?' If they stink, it's them
@CalebBlount that's true. and that's the argument to make. but the argument that was made didn't say that. and that's what i have to score.
@oiler3535 @PTI Way out of my jurisdiction here but I think there was no "astronomy" 500 years ago & "astrologer/astronomer" were 1 in same.
@jadande @CalebBlount Wouldn't 'given where the franchise has been' makes it more compelling of a story? Plus, each franchise=0 Super Bowls
@CalebBlount @jadande I didn't say they weren't posers. They are. We all are. I said to ignore what they've done was elitist.

And I promise, all stories- from Sushi at Pittsburgh Airport to Stranded in Ghana with Bag of Cash- from now on will be less than 5 tweets.
Sorry about the typose, I punted the grammar after the 4th tweet/ 3rd vomit.
@bruce_arthur Good intentions, bad execution, shock, awe, puke, off-the-railsness & incredible luck/blessing is recurring theme in my life
And I'm tired of typing now.
Ring was insured the next day. I hosted every show that week. We got married that year. Apt was rebuilt in 18 months.  ...
uninsured engagement ring in the house during the fire.  Everyone at Horn and PTI let out a cheer (I got ready to vomit) and that's the end.
"was just reunited with here engagement ring. The fire chief pulled it in the rubble."  And that's how I found out Stat Girl left the ...
I'm watching my whole building in destoryed, life a mess & the reporter wraps with: "A bit of good news, a recently engaged young lady..."
I leave in sweatpants & a tshirt and go to the office. News at Noon comes & lead story is the fire because it's the biggest in DC in 20 yrs
Stat Girl whispers to him. I think it's odd because we have no pets.  But I have to go to work, because I have no backup to host Horn, so
Under control. EVERYONE GOT OUT and that's most important. 7am, fire chief says they can go into the building & save pets....
Our apt was the top 2 floors. We lost everything.  What am I doing? Vomiting into the street, of course.  It took 5 hours for DCFD to get it
And expecting to see puffs of smoke, see BALLS OF FIRE on the roof. Fire Dept runs in, then runs out 5 minutes later. The roof collapses...
Our apartment building catches fire.  It's 2am, and Stat Girl is the one that notices. We bang on all doors get everyone out of the building
Not the end of the story about the ring, though.  Two weeks later, with the insurance papers on the desk ready to be - BUT NOT YET mailed...
And that's my/Our engagement story. And, God Willing, the story I'll tell little Fiorello and Fiorella LaGuardia Reali when they're born.
A custodian was buffing the floor when I popped the question. LaGuardia's Marine Terminal bathroom: Most Romantic Place on Earth. #TrueStory
Rip open the box to get to the ring. See the ring, drag Stat Girl between the Men's and Women's bathroom at LaGuardia & propose right there
Get to LaGuardia, see the people, see the bag. Ignore the dude, rip open the bag to get to the shoe. Rip open the shoe to get to the box...
As we drive to LaGuardia with the hotel manager, I'm technicolor yawning out the window. The ring is uninsured and if it's gone, it's gone.
A couple checked out minutes before and were given both bags. At curbside check-in they realized and called the hotel. #KindnessOfStrangers
And the porter comes running out, "We've located the bag. It's at LaGuardia Airport."  WHAT? #projectilevomit #thishappened
Stat Girl gets suspicious. I get nauseous. Seconds feel like hours. Minutes feel like a Woody Paige facetime. I'm gonna vom. Get air outside
Hotel has no clue where bag is, I tell them (discreetly so Stat Girl wouldn't hear) that engagement ring was in bag. Hotel Manager cries.
Stop back at hotel on way to airport, cab meter running. I run in,  they open safe, and...EMPTY.  They go to the backup safe...EMPTY #VOMIT
We're going out all day to a parade with a million people & I'm not getting pickpocketed in my city. So I give the ring, they give me ticket
In NYC. The Ring in a box, in my shoe, in a bag, in the safe, behind the desk at the Chambers Hotel. Gave it to hotel because I'm no stoonad
Alright, since I brought it up, here's my engagement story.  This should take a few tweets so unfollow if I'm your overloading your line.

@ClinteastwoodSR We spent 2 minutes on it.  1 minute more than Rodgers 4td/145 rating, 2 minutes more than Matt Ryan's 3td/120 rating.
@Th3Gizmo Right. That's what I had. 10 thousand hours equals 20,000 1/2hour shows.  And with 1000 shows in the bag, Timmy need 19,000 more.

@CAD5000 kb said precisely that-that invoking plantation prohibits the conversation from going deeper. Same was said was on PTI.

Now THAT'S funny! RT @HochsRightBicep: Let's make this an elite ref conversation. Either you're me, or you're not.
So tired of the "elite" QB conversation...who cares?! If you win you're elite...if you don't you're not...it's real simple.
Two best referees when I was playing were Red Cashion & Jerry Markbreit...appreciated the way they controlled a game & respected the players
Referee Gene Steratore has always been a referee in command...I've respectfully referred to him as "The Sheriff"...he's one of the best.
NFL has prioritized getting tough on labor over integrity of game but Commissioner is simply a broker for owners http://t.co/fYP4ppee
These games are a joke.
Hope so...never liked it to begin with. #bushleague RT @thecommishes: Is it time to stop icing kickers?

An irresponsible explanation for not wearing protective gear RT @Shanej37: likely to cause more contact in a contact-less game? @USlacrosse

@davidalancrow & if Giants hadn't won their last 2 games they wouldn't have gotten in the playoffs & won the Super Bowl. What's your point?
Lots to consider re: Peyton decision...49ers looked to be best fit but don't know all the variables affecting decision & may never know.
Not anymore. RT @USANFL: @lizzylondon Your too nice Troy! That decision sucked! #Broncos have worst offense of those he considered.
Another team RT @imalovelyman: Where do u figure Tebow will fit in the Broncos' plans w Peyton taking his starting job? FB? RB? TE?
Would've loved to see him in the NFC but a good choice. RT @LizzyLondon: What do you think of Manning's decision?
Yes, grand opening for very first Wingstop SPORTS. RT @TheRantingDead: Is it true you're going to be in Brownsville TX tomorrow?
Absolutely, they were top 4 last year without him. RT @BrandonWingo1: do u rate Denver top3 in AFC now, with Peyton?
49ers would be a good fit. RT @WFlyge: Will #49ers sneak in a grab Manning?
Have filled needs w limited cap space. RT @JulianMckelvey: What do u think of cowboys free agent signings so far??
Finished "Unbroken" by Laura Hillenbrand...excellent! Louis Zamperini & countless other POW's are an inspiration for generations to come.

You're beautiful too : ) RT @IrmaWinthrop: @TroyAikman never retweets or answers my questions. Is it bc I don't look like @mariamenounos?

Lots of traffic on the 101 going to Candlestick...rain coming down pretty good too.
Saw Eddie Debartolo, Jr in the gym this am...will serve as 49ers honorary captain for coin toss...great 49er teams & players under his watch
Strong winds impact passing game most. RT @SevenwithaT: Why would it be a factor? Rain and strong wind is not exclusive to San Francisco.
Never a factor when I played there but could be tomorrow RT @MandMSportshow: How difficult were the winds in Candlestick?
You too?  RT @thespoiler28: I've been diagnosed with charasthma - so much charisma that it makes it hard to breathe, any advice?

Arrivig at Lambeau http://t.co/6DtynWD7
Getting morning workout in before heading over to Lambeau
Great example of good coverage & Brees throwing away from defender & trusting his receiver would adjust to the throw.
You're kidding, right? RT @jeffreymartens: Didn't need xtra week. Fangio would've done just as good w no xtra ... http://t.co/bMgLjsLP
Vic Fangio has called an excellent game for 49ers defense...showing what an extra week to prepare can do for a team.
Those catches are required to win games in the postseason. RT @Reptilian13: That was a big time pass, tough catch ... http://t.co/nCy5lcGr
@stromile88 Thought is to get to a manageable 3rd down distance but can't become predictable calling a run on every 2nd & long either.
Yes, didn't take THAT many hits! Some epic battles against them. #muchrespect RT @KingG2k11: Remember playing the 49ers in the playoffs?
Nowhere to throw w that kind of protection is impressive coverage by 49ers secondary...giving a lot of different looks.
Good for him...I couldn't pull that combo off. RT @shelbykitchens: What do you think about Moose's shirt/tie combo?
3rd & 3 and Brees takes shot to endzone...that's a confident QB...perfect throw.
49ers not giving up any big throws down field. Brees completing high % of passes. Big play offenses can get frustrated if that continues.
Favorite weekend of the NFL season...can't wait for 49ers/Saints on @NFLONFOX...@daryljohnston on the call says field is best he's ever seen
Congratulations Captain. RT @Murph_clp: Can I get a RT from one of my Cowboys heroes, I was promoted to Captain in the Houston Fire Dept.

Good decision by Landry Jones to return to OU...he'll benefit from the extra year...as will the Sooners of course.

No protections for week 17...league determines the NBC game. RT @Cowboycalebmem: Why did fox not protect the cowboys/giants game?
A beautiful morning in Aspen as we make our way back to Dallas. http://t.co/lGHwEG5D
For the record, Dan Marino has always been my favorite QB but I give Joe Montana the nod for best ever.
Records don't mean much...winning is what matters. RT @judyaj8: Were you sad when any of your records were broken?
Little doubt Drew Brees breaks Marino's record tonight...don't know if Dan is at the game but it'd be pretty cool if he's in attendance.
Aspen-bound for a few days of skiing with my girls...can't wait!

Sure they do but each generation is different. RT @shane_emerson: Do you think today's players respect the game the way y'all did
No. RT @DCFanaticsBlog: Jerry compared this team to the 90's teams saying they both made stupid mistakes. Doesn't that comparison anger you?
A great one AND one of the all-time great guys too. RT @sbass1310: Do you consider Steve Beuerlein your best backup qb you had?
Can always do more but it is a priority for NFL RT @T_Freezy05: Is the NFL doing enough to both prevent &then treat current/former players?

@Peridot2681 Bill Belichick #NFLMobile
@lgeoca - 49ers because of what was at stake when we played each other...3 straight NFC Championship Games #NFLMobile
@MePascal - If they don't believe by now, they are not going to believe #NFLMobile
@jwitchard - I do. They were my preseason pick to win the South #NFLMobile
@amdinapoli - As of right now it's hard to bet against New York #NFLMobile
@thairandolph - Joe Montana, but before he's through Peyton Manning maybe the best of our generation #NFLMobile
@jwitchard - Its likely, but a potential work stoppage could impact whether head coaches will lose their jobs #NFLMobile
@chinnmusic - No. I think they need offensive line help #NFLMobile
@Peridot2681 - The rematch of Pittsburgh & Baltimore #NFLMobile
@thairandolph - Highlight of my career was three World Championships.
@Etrader - Yes its possible, but it becomes a pain tolerance question and long term damage.
@lgeoca - Favorite Cowboys memory was following the TD to Alvin Harper in SB XXVII and celelbrating with teammates on the sideline.

I guess they're not too concerned with college basketball players since they're considering expanding March Madness to 96 teams.
NCAA would like for us to believe they're concerned about the kids (too many games) so therefore no playoff system.
College Bowls were once awarded to teams for great years; Now they're awarded for mediocrity. Reasons are clear...more revenue.
Cowboys went from a December punchline to a legitimate playoff contender...all within 3.5 hours.
Joe Montana gets my vote. RT @RicNasty: I agree with ur statement Peyton is the most consistent qb. I'm just curious is he the best ever?
Gotta be impressed with Jags too.  Haven't beat many good teams this year.  This would validate them as a playoff contender.
How many times have we seen this performance from Peyton? The most consistent QB - week in & week out - I've ever seen.

@riggo44 Riggo ur right...clean by letter of the rule but still type of hit the NFL is trying to eliminate. He was defenseless nonetheless.
G'morning everyone! Great day for some football. Can't wait for the games to begin. Have a great Sunday and best of luck to all your teams!
Beautiful weather in Dallas...going to enjoy it with a 5 mile jog. Hope everyone is enjoying their weekend!
Just watched 4th grade pop warner football. Haven't watched kids that young play football in a LONG time...great fun!
Just finished Fox crew dinner @ Neighborhood Services. Awesome meal & great staff!  Thanks Nick!
@FozzyFiend Surprisingly, you're the first one!
Finished production meetings w/ Cowboys & weekly spot on WFAN with Francessa. Fox crew dinner 2nite in Dallas. Great 2 be home on a Friday!
@NYYanks42 I enjoy the weekly visit with Francessa and always listen/watch the show when I'm in New York.
@NYYanks42 I'm covering Falcons/Cowboys this weekend. Great to not travel for a change AND see my girls over the weekend!
Thank u to everyone that came out to the Katy Trail tonight. Great seeing all of you! Appreciate your support of the Trail!
Don't forget to grab your friends (& coat) and come by the Katy Trail tonight @ 6 p.m. Live band & refreshments on hand! See you there!
@dhanberry Can't handle the fact the Saints are for real? What's not to like? Great coach & QB, defense playing great. They're legit!
@StephenMBryant typically at card shows or other public appearances the people organizing the event charge a fee for autographs.
Stop by the Katy Trail tomorrow from 6-7 p.m. & join "Friends of the Katy Trail" and get a free autograph. Hope to see you there!
@Pierre_Thomas You're playin well. Keep up the good work!
@millicanca I will sign personal items but u need to become member of Katy Trail. Depending on # of people autographs could be limited to 1
@Brisblondie visit katietraildallas.org 4 more info. Katy Trail is not maintained by the city of Dallas but rather thru private donations.

Great win today by Saints. They are legit. The Giants are still a good team...just ran into a hot hand in Drew Brees. They'll be fine.
@joebucklive great game partner! We'll miss ya in the Big Easy today!
Ate at a GREAT restaurant last night in New Orleans...it's called Mr. John's.  Desi, the owner, and his 7 year old daughter are awesome!
Catching up this a.m. on this week's "Curb Your Enthusiasm"...great show!  Any other Curb fans?
Date night with my 7 & 8 year old daughters...great fun as long as mac-n-cheese is a part of the dinner! LOL
A Happy 99th Birthday shout out to our very own Wizard of Westwood...Coach John Wooden.  Happy Birthday Coach!!!!!
Vikings offense & defense AER rankings this week are why I came up with the rankings.  Yards don't tell the whole story on why they're 5-0.

60 degrees in Dallas today and just finished a 5 mile run...felt great!  U2 concert tonight at Cowboys Stadium. I've never seen them live!
@_Robert_D We haven't officially received our assignments for that weekend but I'd be surprised if we weren't there for that game.
@RichShockey Thank you.  How 'bout them Giants?!  They are really playing well...a great matchup this weekend with the Saints!
@hdvgirl Lambeau is a great tailgating site as well.  I'll be there for the Vikings/Packers rematch in a couple weeks...get the brats ready!
Cold morning in Kansas City. Shouldn't deter the tailgaters...Arrowhead is one of the all-time great tailgating stadiums. Enjoy the games!
@RickElliottJr Will be serving Jack Stack BBQ at our production meeting this evening.
The BBQ the Chiefs PR staff brought in today was from L.C.'s...it was AWESOME!  Thanks Pete!!!
Just touched down in Kansas City. Chiefs practice & meetings with Todd Haley, Clancy Pendergast & Matt Cassel.
Early morning workout before leaving for Kansas City.  Chiefs practice @ 10 a.m. CT with KC BBQ following...can't wait!!!!
The girls loved the movie!  Mom & Dad found it pretty entertaining as well.  Gotta love Mr. T (Laurence Tureaud)!
Movie night w/ the family..."Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs". Movie review to come.
@mcglinch LOL...I'll see if I can get Fox to remove the pictures.  Hope it at least curbed your appetite.
@malasander An amazing event! Sure makes you proud of the cause and the progress that's being made to cure paralysis.
Flying back to Big D tonight. It'll be an early morning arrival...car pooling kids to school in the a.m. It's the highlight of my day.
Just wrapped up the Buoniconti Fund Dinner in NYC...what an inspiring night. Hopeful a cure for paralysis is imminent.
@CindyCrawford maybe there's an entirely new set of issues we're unaware of...just saying! LOL
Off to New York for the Buoniconti Fund Dinner benfefitting the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis.
Doesn't look like the ratings are showing up very clean for some reason.  Sorry.  I'll try to address the issue later.

@twitemily Coach Joe was telling me about Lady's Locker Room today at lunch.  Said it was fun...Hope he actually spoke about football!
@yourcuppycake No. Coach Joe owns a sports bar in town & is also doing some local TV & radio.
Just finished lunch w/ longtime Cowboys special team's coach Joe Avezzano. It was good to catch up. He's doing great!
@jffcrmr good point!
What an exciting finish! Can't question the Broncos defense now. They kept the game close & delivered with game on the line.
We're about 12 minutes from kickoff in Denver. Enjoy the game everybody!
Getting workout in before heading over to Invesco Field for Broncos/Cowboys.  I love football Sundays!
@jsherm916 Broke my leg...Jamille Holloway came in and led the Sooners to national championship.  I transferred to UCLA.
Watching OU/Miami game reminds me of breaking my leg in '85.  Some great games between these 2 teams in the late 80's.
Tomorrow's Cowboys/Broncos matchup should provide clearer picture of the Broncos.  Quality of opponents questioned in 3-0 start.
Anyone else get annoyed with those that OVER tweet? I'm not THAT interested in what ANYONE is doing!

Headed to the gym. Much needed after the weekend in Foxboro...Luciano's, pizza, ice cream!
Rain beginning to fall but doesn't look to affect the QB's...at least not in pregame warmups.
@MJThrill Ate at Luciano's Friday night. We eat there every trip to Foxboro...OUTSTANDING!

I thought Irv was great on DWTS last night. He'll be needing the call-in votes so let's help 'em out.
Impressive win today by the Saints. Thought Kevin Kolb was "OK". Didn't get much help from defense or special teams.
@jdkeese My nephew played with Tre Newton in Pop Warner.  He was a RB then too but never would have thought he'd still be a RB in college!
Just remembered the Texas/Texas Tech game was on!  Mack Brown was my Offensive Coordinator freshman year at OU - Go Horns!
Wrapping up preparations for Eagles/Saints over a turkey burger from room service - and you thought this was glamorous!
A beautiful day in Philadelphia...Eagles/Saints should be quite a game tomorrow! 1 p.m. ET

For those that have asked, I have this week's Aikman Efficiency Ratings. Would post here but not sure best way to do it. Any ideas?
Great to get workout out of the way 1st thing in the morning! Sporting News Radio taping in an hour.
Big week 1 fantasy win for Troy's Boys.  I guess drafting Drew Brees was a good pick after all!
@michaelstrahan Stra- You're livin' the good life...I should have learned how to rush the passer!
@fredmaidment Wasn't dissing Herschel whatsoever. It was a joke because so much made of that trade. Herschel is a friend...lighten up.
Congratulations to UCLA on a really good road win @ Tennessee & a 2-0 start.
A shout out to stevallica.com for handling the graphics design on my twitter page.  Thanks Steve!
@bonnied16 good luck to Zachary! Don't be afraid to put a golf club in his hand either! LOL
@jerryn Green Bay would have had the #1 pick if they had lost the final game in '88.
Make sure to follow @NFLONFOX. They'll have news & behind the scenes access from FOX game sites & the pregame crew all season long!
Making media rounds in NYC for Campbell's Soup. Just finished Fox & Friends & Al Roker on Weather Channel. Jim Rhome & NFL Net later today.
@BrianDH83 We've got Redskins @ Giants this week. Maybe the best season opener we've had with NFC East clash.
@michaelstrahan Stra- You can take him!  He doesn't handle pressure very well...LOL (that'll stir 'em up!!)
@effbot Aikman Efficiency Ratings will begin following week 1.
Enjoying last weekend before NFL season kicks off. Some really good college games over the holiday weekend too. Go UCLA!
@victorandmatt Leigh Steinberg is still a very close friend but no longer represents me.  Jordan Bazant from The Agency is my representative
Interested in hearing what you want to hear from the broadcasters while watching an NFL game. Looking forward to week 1.
Change of plans for fantasy team following quite a reaction to "Men of Troy".  The new name will be "Troy's Boys"  Enjoy the game tonight.
Thanks for the replies...going with "Men of Troy". Several suggested that one.
@Derrick1972 Michael Turner
Need a name for my fantasy team...suggestions?
@jacobu puh-leaze!
Mel Kiper loves my draft!
RB Cadillac Williams...either he or Derrick Ward is going to get A LOT of carries this year!
Jake Delhomme
@tormike that was my thinking too.
8th Round: Hines Ward
@JoeSteelerfan we have 15 teams...players are flying off the board.
Vikings Defense
This is new to me...you all are killing my draft! LOL

Not many liked my Dallas Clark selection. What position for my next pick?
4th round: Dallas Clark

With the 9th pick I took Drew Brees
Brees or Andre Johnson
Drew Brees or Tom Brady
Our Fox Fantasy Draft is about to begin. I've got the 9th pick...any suggestions from the fantasy gurus?
@conradh That would be pretty cool for sure!
@Humble63 if there was a Mt. Rushmore for QB's I wouldn't argue with those four but what about Joe Montana?

@slaterfan Good question...in all the years I've known Irv I've NEVER seen him dance! Don't count him out though...hardest working guy ever!

Petco Park...what a great venue. Can't beat America's past time in San Diego in June.
Hoping to see some of you Padres fans @ Petco Park tomorrow night!
Norman Brinker was a true titan of the restaurant industry. His impact on those he touched is enormous. We will miss our friend.
Don't get me wrong, I like the Lakers & I appreciate what they've done. Simply as a neutral fan I would have liked a game 7.
Watching the Lakers/Magic & thinking about how good this series could have been.

Beautiful day @ Southern Hills in Tulsa, Ok...feels good to be back in my old stomping grounds...even if just 4 a day.

Why is it that in charity golf tournament there is someone in every fivesome that thinks he's Tiger Woods?
At Tom Coughlin's Jay Fund Golf Tournament in Jacksonville. Pretty obvious how meaningful this is to the Coach.
At poker tournament with Irvin, Emmitt & Moose. Lucky for me they were much better football players.
Now that the NFL Draft is over, what are we supposed to do until preseason starts in August?
I miss football this time of year but it sure is nice being home with the family on weekends. Girls started softball today...good stuff!
A lot of people questioned Mark Sanchez's decision to go pro. At least financially, it was a good decision on his part.
Look for lots of grades tomorrow on how teams did in NFL Draft.  Ridiculous! NO ONE will know how anyone did for at least a couple of years
Stafford picking up the tab at our next dinner.
Enjoying Jon Gruden's insight on NFL Network's draft coverage.
Happy for Matthew Stafford...hard to believe it was 20 years ago today I was with the Commissioner as the #1 pick.
I'm focused on football this week with the NFL draft but a tough 1-0 Padres loss in extra innings...good pitching Chris Young!
In every draft there's a "best" QB but does that mean in every draft there's a "franchise" QB?
Anxious week for those collegiate players awaiting this weekend's NFL Draft!
Padres do it again in the 9th!!!
Well, quite a battle but won the tournament on the last hole...almost as exciting as some of our wins in the '90's!
Leading by 1 shot going into final round of tournament.
Great comeback victory by the Padres last night...off to a great start!
I, Along with millions of football fans across the country, will miss hearing John Madden...the greatest color analyst of our time.

Stare down in the mirror. Slap myself silly. Pep talk. Sprint in place. Stretch. Hydrate. Last chance for Christmas shopping. Kill. Me.
Now go out there and have crazy, fun weekends, you crazy kids!
We buy car insurance. Odds we get in accident? Marriages have a 50/50 success rate and a prenup is cynical? 1/2 empty glass of water for me.
Have we not reached the point at which all marriages should be accompanied by a prenup? What am I missing?
It is now confirmed @CJAstros23, u r crazy! But congrats to Dr John Reyes on the bat! (florida sun getting to cj)
No Colin today. Doing another episode of Beadle's Beatdown...the show sweeping Eastern Europe by storm! 5 mystery guests lots of prizes.

What the h is this?!?! This is NOT Monday Night Football. I'm going outside and taking a nap in the middle of the street
Just as I was getting my chair in position to stare at the wall in silence, Revis steps up. I shall keep football on
I love soup so much. That is all.
Just caught my friend Randy Bernard having to announce the death of Dan Wheldon at INDY. Whatever you do in these times, please do it.
Drove home from airport at 160 mph but not before pulling over 3 times to change my tires in 12 seconds. Thanks to @CalebHurd and co!
Just getting service back and leaving the track. Tough day for the 88 team but an AMAZING time. Pooped! http://t.co/Q6kTFUod
Just got a tour of Rick Hendrick's private car collection with the man himself. They call it "redneck Disney World." I call it heaven.

Looky loo...somebody got scurred of all the smack talking and joined twitternation: @stanverrett you're the worst driver of the day!

Put down that pastrami sandwich, brother! It's podcast time. Hulk Hogan stops by to get rowdy and chat.  A blast. http://t.co/7kQMwGYP
WHY is @ESPN_Colin calling wrestling fans booger eaters? I will storm that studio, pull that lil' hoodie over his head and drop kick his...
At the risk of sounding uber self-promotional & annoying, stick around for the end of today's show! Especially if you're a fan of 80's music
After seeing the Dr. Pepper 10 ad (tagline: "it's not for women"), I drank it anyways. Now I have mommy issues and fear of commitment. Great
I'm gonna run Monday Night Raw!!! Oh wait....
So Sheamus and Cena stick with HHH. What will Punk do? #watchingrawandmnf
Why does baseball force us to choose between NFL and the playoffs? They can never, EVER win that fight.
Prepping for the show today with my buddy @ESPN_Colin. I'm thinking about getting my sing on! Oh u didn't know? I write songs. Be warned.
LOVE seeing Kathryn Tappen kick butt on NHL Network. Once worked together and the powers never gave her a legit shot. #suitsdontalwaysknow

Horse. Poop.

Toughest decision I have today: what bingeworthy food do I want to go get for my 7 hours of RedZone. Leaning toward Mo's...life is hard

Hey @markschlereth I'm waiting on a big ol' box of Detroit Tigers gear. You ARE hooking us up, yes?
Back in NYC and headed to CT. Delays couldn't  keep this steel trap down. Missing my little Leroy Jenkins. (and maybe @ESPN_Colin a tad)
What's the deal in NYC? Did a breeze blow over LGA? Maybe a single crack of lightening? Delayed at least an hour on runway in ATL. LGA=soft
Soon to be neighbor on the plane: I apologize for the snoring, sniffling mess you will inevitably see and hear.  Mornings are my enemy.

Congrats on big win. I credit u entirely! RT @MarkHerzlich so no love anymore haven't years from you in months. Thought we were tight.
Just landed in Atlanta on way to Arizona, and thought you guys were messing with me on Bills win. Looks like picking Buffalo wasn't crazy!
If wanting to run into my wall face first is the effect Radiohead is going for, then they are awesome! What's that? People like this? Oh.
If I could make money sitting around being grumpy and eating donuts, I would have been able to retire today.
Bummed I'm missing the #bwb4 festivities in NYC..but pumped to be heading to Tucson for the week and the #espnWsummit. Be ready @lindacohn!

Podcast time in this joint: http://t.co/KnJ4EzOx. Guess what? We're talking Hollywooooood with @ewsandrag and @JacquelinePurdy
Note to WWE stars: do not invite family to hometown shows. Beth yesterday. Miz today. You're fired. And can still catch the 4th quarter MNF.
Taking a #RAW break...I respect Hugh Jackman too much to watch the Real Steel trailer..@JohnIsner SinCara's is baby-making music! (Times 2)
HHH remains COO. Fun watch! For all you nosy Nellies concerned with my NFL intake, I invested in this futuristic info box. Computer? #2011
Kevin Nash going for the always sexy wedgie move on HHH...

11 minutes from @WWE Night of Champions..I have a bad feeling about Punk tonight. If u don't want NOC tweets, I got 2 words for ya..let's go
Just cheered out loud by myself at the Bill-Raiders game. Either I'm suffering from a stroke or this was game of the day so far

Imagine that Trickett kid's throwing skills when he gets his first man muscles. #notrootingforsooners
Few things make me cringe more than panelists on Bill Maher making comments they are CONVINCED are zingers. Crickets. Also, I love Louie CK
Huge congrats to @crystalthune on winning week 1 of our fanalyst contest! U sounded and looked great! Expect u on tv in the future!
TV is simple. watching Bill Belichick: A Football Life. Story on a team and man I don't root for. Still can't turn it off. Good stuff

Time for a little RAW! Hey there. Come here often? Wanna chat? wwe.me/6swzO
Watching this US Open makes me uncomfortable. Reminds me of my first apartment in New York. #thewallswerepaperthin #awkwardgrunting
Ice cream sandwiches locked and loaded. Tonight we're going with the Ciao Bella Key Lime Graham squares. MNF and RAW! Oh, how I've missed u.

Wrong! Leroy goes on vacation with me. And I'd take him over any one of these whiny babies. RT @awquinla: Dogs don't belong on airplanes.

This pic is from where pops lives. Insanity. RT @Vreeke5: Hole #13 on Live Oak @ESPN_Michelle http://t.co/Z59DxfN
Crazy pics coming in constantly. Evacuations and helicopters using golf course ponds to try and stop fires. Bob Beadle remains cool.
Without knowing anyone involved, I'm beyond sad for those lost in the Russian plane crash. For those who fear flying, it's incomprehensible.
With the Texas fires closing in on family and friends, I'm thinking about all of you. Bob Beadle doesn't get worried. And Bob is worried.
Loving the WWE updates guys! Do not fret, for I have been wearing my "best in the world" tee while frolicking thru Italia. vivailrevoluzione
You guys are suckas! Heck no, I didn't get married. Walked in a fashion show (insert joke here) and that dress left burn marks #nonhosposato

Verifying rights: while running in this small Italian town, if I accidentally push a kid on a Vespa over, I have diplomatic immunity, yes?
Crazy watching all Irene coverage from overseas. And thanks to twitter for the updates (looking at you, @AnitaMarks) stay safe NYC.

Watched 13 min of Jersey Shore in Italy. And I'm done.They are a walking cesspool of ignorance. And proud to be so. We owe Italy an apology.

"Look at that perfect throw by Tony Romo..." #ThingsIDidNotExpectToHearToday
Oh yeah, nothing to see down in Houston except CHAD HENNE HAS 331 PASSING YARDS AND 4 TD
RT @ESPN_FirstTake: Meanwhile @RGIII is frying birds down in DC!
This is true RT @sportspickle @SportsNation The Cowboys losing a football game is not an upset, regardless of opponent.
RT @M_G0NZ: @SportsNation Jaguars over Texans for sure! It's never an upset beating Tony Romo
Which upset would shock you more: Browns over the Cowboys, or Jaguars over the Texans?
Good news for Cowboys fans: it is halftime, and Tony Romo hasn't thrown a pick yet. Bad news: he is being outplayed by Brandon Weeden.
Nick Foles has Michael Vick's ability to fumble, and Tony Romo's ability to throw picks. If only he had...MANNING FACE.
RT @ESPN_Numbers: 3. Matt Ryan has thrown three INT in the same quarter for the first time in his career.
