Congratulations to 2012 Sprint Cup Champion Brad @Keselowski
Bill Belichick's defense is feasting on Andrew Luck in today's blowout. Second pick-six of the day.
@PTP819 You're a Cowboys fan, right? Close call today.
Chris Ivory came close to breaking another one. A 25-yard run wasn't bad in any case.
@PTP819 Ha! Yes Schaub was incredible but nobody thought the Jags would stay in the contest. Freeman wasn't awful (3 TDs)
Give one back. The officials overturn the last fumble by Rod Streater.
The Saints defense is on a takeaway mission today. Three turnovers by the Raiders.
In his first game for a new team Aqib Talib pays instant dividends for the Patriots on a 59-yard TD return of an Andrew Luck interception.
@TerrazasManny 7 runs for 55 yards.
Andre Johnson ends up with 273 yards including the game-winning 48-yard overtime game winning TD.
Dan Bailey's 38-yard FG gives Dallas a 23-20 OT win over Cleveland.
Bucs complete the stunning comeback on a Freeman to Dallas Clark TD in OT.
Freeman and Jackson convert the 2-point play. Tie game likely headed for OT.
A bullet throw from Josh Freeman to Vincent Jackson for a 24-yrd TD puts the Bucs a 2-pt try from a tie in Carolina.
Entering today only Troy Aikman (15) had more 4th Q comebacks for the Cowboys than Tony Romo (14). Next Roger Staubach (13) Danny White (11)
Touchdown Benjamin Watson from Brandon Weeden to give the Browns the lead and quiet the Jerrydome. Still 1:07 to go
Matt Ryan now has thrown FIVE interceptions.
The answer: The only other Jaguar to throw 4 TDs against the Texans was Quinn Gray on Dec. 30, 2007. That game was also in Houston.
Great catch by Randall Cobb to adjust to the ball in the end zone between two defenders for a 22-yard TD grab.
@Awade21 That's the one.
Hint: the answer to the Jaguars 4 TD Q is NOT Steve Buerlein, Mark Brunell, Byron Leftwich or David Garrard.
Chad Henne is the second #Jaguars QB to throw for 4 TDs against Houston. Who was the first?
Romo to Dez Bryant puts the Cowboys ahead of Cleveland.
Ok, who had Chad Henne with four TDs and Matt Ryan with four INTs today? #OppositeDay
Bilal Powell scores his second rushing TD of the quarter for the Jets. Shonn Greene owners beware.
Megatron with leap, a score, and a stuff over the goalpost.

@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino McGahee
Cecil Shorts strikes again. 67-yard score from Henne.
Captain Munnerlyn with a 74-yard pick six of Josh Freeman. Still 10-7 Tampa Bay.
Aaron Rodgers to Jermichael Finley. TD Packers.
Two QBs have thrown three 1st Q INTs in past 4 years: Peyton Manning 9/17/12 vs Atlanta and Matt Ryan today for Atlanta.
Dalton to AJ Green gives the Bengals the lead. Only the Ravens on opening day have kept Green out of the end zone this year. #AllPro
@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino There's a long way to go.
@DrSamMorris scored in OT.
Nick Foles is having a tough starting debut so far. Two picks in the 1st Q.
In what's become routine Chad Henne replaces an injured Blaine Gabbert for the Jags in Houston.
After not holding a lead all season, KC grabs an advantage for the second week in a row. KC 3, Cin 0.
LaRod Stephens-Howling scores the 10th rushing TD of the season against the Falcons. Cards take the early lead.
@JTWarmoth7 Jones.
@Semery10 None are good choices but roll with Brown.
Send your #fantasyfootball questions/comments to @SI_DavidSabino throughout the week and here on Sunday pre-kickoff for lineup help.
@HazelAcev Freeman. Been outstanding recently.
@Semery10 Sproles should play. I like him better than DWill. TB very tough vs. run.
@bhayden21 Tough spot. Smith and cross fingers Flacco can get it to him.
Colts play at the Patriots today.  Including playoffs Tom Brady has topped 300 pass yards once in 8 career games vs. Indy at Foxboro ('04)
@Boomerseven No. I like Turner more for touchdown potential.
@LynnKupfer I'd go with James Jones but the other two should have good days too.
@mgugs46 Have to figure Cooper and Foles have worked a lot together in practice. Not a bad play over Shorts.
@margolin23 I like James Jones today vs. Detroit. The Pack should be fresh after a week off.
@LynnKupfer All are great but Mike Williams is the safest bet with Jones ailing.
Greg Jennings, Kevin Kolb, Joe Haden, DeMarco Murray, Mike Vick, Jason Avant, Andrew Hawkins all inactive for today's early games.
@margolin23 I like Alexander vs. the Broncos.
@deafjeffm  Garcon for Roberts is interesting. I'd probably do that.
@LynnKupfer @SI_DavidSabino I'd use Rivers who will find Gates a lot. Foles has a good matchup but no idea how he'll handle his 1st start.
@HazelAcev Both have major questions. I'd use Jones and hope he can gut it out the entire game.
@vtgoad I'd use Young. GB backs have been a major disappointment since Benson went down.
@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino @Playoffs You too. Let's get that 5-5 team a little better.
@vtgoad I'd use Romo.
RT @ChrisBurke_SI: Pierre Garcon, Julio Jones ready to go: NFL Week 11 key actives/inactives http://t.co/JsiO6pqD

@TerrazasManny Jones playing but could be limited. Mathews also iffy. I'f you have strong alternatives use them.
@pkeithb81 I like Bradford but Foles has a good matchup. Question is can he handle it? Not sure.
@PTP819 I'd go with Freeman and Witten.
@wilkentj Davis invisible recently and Bears tougher vs. TE. Vereen strictly a complementary player.
@paligap914 @SI_DavidSabino Austin.

Bills win. Send your fantasy Qs to @SI_DavidSabino throughout the wek or here on Sunday AMs.
Davone Bess gets his first TD of the year. Amazingly Miami i now down just five points 19-14.
Knicks remain undefeated, go to San Antonio and beat the Spurs 104-100.
Reggie Bush thru the first 5 games: 417 rushing yards. Over the last 4.5 games: 138 rushing yards including net zero on 7 carries tonight.
Dolphins 50 net yards of offense, 0-5 on third down, allowed four first downs on penalties.
For the Dolphins to have played so poorly yet be just 12 down at the half is astounding. Buffalo 19-7.
Classic alligator arms for Tashard Choice on that last pass.
Time of possession: Buffalo 10:18; Miami 3:59.
96-yard kickoff return by Marcus Thigpen. TD Miami. 10-7 Bills. It's all special teams.
79 Yard punt return for Leodis McKelvin. Buffalo 7-0.
@BreakdownSheets you got it.
@jwjunker Correct
Bonus question: Before Miggy and JV who were the last pair of Detroit Tigers to win back-to-back MVPs?
@McFleet711 Admiration and a feeling of satisfaction.
The last AL team before the Tigers to have different MVPs in back to back seasons was the Rangers: Juan Gonzalez '98, Pudge Rodriguez '99
@REALGeoNio Nope
@peters_dylan Right
@dkuhn119 They did it in NL. Who did in AL?
@purdmanJR Correct.
@Curtos07 Yes
@WAF2004 Got it.
Miguel Cabrera followed Justin Verlander as #MVP #Tigers. What was the last AL team to have consecutive MVPs won by different players?
@deafjeffm Yes. Better than Allen.
Miami opponents average 42.0 pass attempts/game. If it remains that high It'll be the most against any AFL or NFL team in history.
The temp is in the low 30s for tonight's game. Miami's record in the last six sub-40-degree games at Buffalo: 3-3.
@BMoreRaven33 @SI_DavidSabino No forgetting that. But the Jets are a mess on offense. I'd stick with Boldin despite the tough matchup.
It's confirmed that Fred Jackson is inactive for tonight's Bills-Dolphins game making C.J. Spiller a great fantasy start.

Peyton Manning just tied Dan Marino with his 420th career TD pass.
DPI is the bane of the fantasy owners existence. Lloyd misses a TD on interference. Ridley closes it out.
Antonio Gates' roll continues. Scores another TD to put SD ahead.
Why is it that Chris Ivory didn't play most of the 1st half of the season? Spectacular 56-yard TD run. Showed everything you want from RB.
Greg Olsen just the latest tight end to score against the Broncos. It's a matchup to watch every week.

@RWFlintstone Stafford
@jpcookinass Neither bad. Smith safer.

@DBuettner23 Bears too good to sit.
@wcf8089 Britt.
Percy Harvin, Aaron Hernandez, Darren McFadden, Mike Goodson, Darren Sproles all INACTIVE
@Naxx_23 PPR go with Amendola.
@PeteBecks Both have plenty of upside. I'd lean towards Ivory in a high-scoring game.
@mbgoldy Young and Boldin.
@thesplosion Use the starters-Bradshaw/Bush/Fred.

@MichaelJHoff Joique has been better and will be involved. Give it a shot.

@ianralston13 Obviously love both but Brees is better this week.
@DylanKurtz12 Leshoure
@JoeMacofKC (and I am using them)
@JoeMacofKC I'd use Hartline and Redman.
@JerryPickles I'd start Pettigrew or have Casey/G.Graham/Heath Miller ready to go in Daniels place.

@MNsportsfan24 Turner and Sanders.
@timreid365 Greene and Young.

@RaulCamarena BJGE
@huhl23 Wow. Pittsburgh's the only D I like better than Chicago this week based mainily on KC ineptitude.
@btaylor1978 Miami gives up a ton through the air. I'd give Britt the edge although not shying away from Greene this week.
@wilkentj Giants: Bennett, Cruz, Nicks should be back to normal at Cincinnati.
@HoganMike Have to play the Bears. Dominant fantasy defense should be matchup-proof.
@montysu Wonderful problem. I'd have to use Ryan. Try to trade one for a big RB/WR if you can.
@chris_campagna Lloyd and Leshoure.
@HeatherrGlass Patriots. They'll get some takeaways v. Buffalo.
@npuccine Time for Hail Mary trades/moves and start planning for next year.
@bugler54 Minnesota. Detroit is more mistake prone.
@hollywoodheffne Reece. Daniels is a gametime decision and you can't risk him not playing.
@HeatherrGlass Eli has the better matchup and responds well to the pressure of last two week's struggles. Texans could neutralize Cutler

Doug Martin runs into the end zone for a fourth time today. #gameofalifetime
@LynnKupfer @SI_DavidSabino Very glad it worked out for you.
Touchdown Isaac Redman to give the Steelers the lead. This is the third straight game a Pittsburgh RB has gone over 100-yards rushing.
RT @mattbean1: @SInow NYC folks sans TV (but with Internet) can catch tonight's games on @aereotv
Steelers gamble on a fake field goal flip and fail. Giants retain 20-17 lead.
@aka_MR_FANTASY Only 2 TDs
The five others were Adrian Peterson, Jerome Harrison, Corey Dillon, Shaun Alexander and Mike Anderson.
Only six players since 1960 had as many rushing yards and TDs in a game as Doug Martin has thus far today with a lot of time remaining.
Doug Martin is having one of the greatest rushing days for any rookie in NFL history-18 carries for 244 yards and three touchdowns.
Doug Martin has at least 100 yards from scrimmage in all four games since Tampa Bay's bye and has scored touchdowns in three straight.
Adrian Peterson's 144 1st half rushing yards is highest total of the season. Michael Turner has 172 last season on 1/1 against the Bucs.
Big Ben takes the early advantage over Eli on a scoring toss to Emmanuel Sanders. 7-0 Steelers.
Vincent Jackson to the Bucs was among the most underrated signings of '12. Josh Freeman has excelled since his arrival; Chargers miss him.
The more experienced QB (including Luck over ex-WR Tannehill) has won every game so far in Week 9 with one exception: Cutler over Hasselbeck
Russell Wilson rolls right and hits Sidney Rice for the go-ahead score. Wilson has two TD passes and his receivers have three drops.
@bro2baseball McCoy
Andrew Luck's 433 passing yards today are one more than Cam Newton's rookie single-game record of 432 set last season against GB.
Send your #fantasyfootball questions to our roundtable here or to @SI_DavidSabino. #SIFantasyRoundtable
CJ2K has already been the leading rusher in two weeks (4 & 7) this season. Nobody else has done that more than once.
Chris Johnson's 80-yard TD makes him the day's top rusher and proves yet again that there is no garbage time in #fantasyfootball
Ravens 22, Phil Dawson 15.
This is the 3rd time the #ChicagoBears have scored 40+ pts. this season. The last year Chicago had at least 4 such games? 1948.
Tom Crabtree on a 72-yd TD pass from Rodgers. Has same no. of TD catches (3) as Jermichael Finley-Brandon Pettigrew-Jason Witten combined
Phil Dawson 15, Ravens 14
Touchdown Joel Dreessen gives the Broncos the lead back. It's Dreessen's fourth TD of the season tying him for 5th place among TEs.
Micheal Spurlock's TD in Jacksonville leaves the Jets as the only team to be shutout this season (week 4 vs. 49ers)
Andrew Luck has 273 passing yards in the first half. Peyton Manning only had three first halves with more yardage during his Indy career.
A tremendous catch by James Jones for his eighth TD this season.
The only Lion with four rushing TDs in a game? Of course it was Barry Sanders vs. Minnesota in 1991.
Leshoure with his 3rd TD of the day. The last Lion to run for 3 TDs in a game was James Stewart vs. TB in 2000.
Steve Smith is off the schneid. TD Panthers.
@matt_hartley_ Good one. #rouge?
Robbie Gould's FG is the 5th way the Bears have scored. Need a safety, fumble recovery, kick, punt and missed FG returns to finish set.
The Panthers keep RG3 out of the end zone on fourth and goal. #goallinestand
Mikel Leshoure with his second short TD run of the day. Lions 14-0.
@studmane Chargers 9 was in the AFL.
Demaryius Thomas is back in the game for Denver. #closecall #whew
Brian Urlacher scores the #ChicagoBears 7th touchdown on an interception return this season, one shy of Seattle's NFL mark.
Uh oh. Demaryius Thomas appeared to hurt his right foot on a long completion from Peyton Manning.
Matt Forte gets pushed into the end zone by his offensive linemen for an 8-yard  TD run.
Owen Daniels easily gets behind the Bills defense and Matt Schaub hits him for a TD.
DeAngelo Williams gets his 3rd TD of the season, in the process baffling the officials who originally appeared to rule him out of bounds.
Baltimore's Bernard Pierce scores his first NFL touchdown giving the Ravens a 14-0 lead in Cleveland.
Touchdown Andrew Luck to the ageless Reggie Wayne.
Not to be outdone by the defense, the #ChicagoBears special teams block a punt and return for a TD.
Ray Rice eludes the Browns defense for his 6th rushing TD of the season.
Send your #fantasyfootball Qs to our roundtable here or  to @SI_DavidSabino.

@twixrho9 Eli.
@BrendanHecht Wayne, Stew, Redman.
@yukon_10 With those choices you can afford to be conservative and sit Jordy.

@davierich I'd still use Megatron.
@cdunn808 Young is safer but reports on Johnson were good. Either way Jax secondary is banged up.
@LynnKupfer @SI_DavidSabino Redman, LRSH, Ballard
@davisjuggernaut Jackson vs. Saints is a very appealing matchup.
@vtgoad Redman turned into a PPR monster in his last action. I'd stick with him.
@BrendanMohlerGW I still like Jones.
@MNsportsfan24 Wouldn't play if he couldn't contribute. I'd use JOrdy.
@yvoids18 Jackson should play too.
@wcf8089 I like him but no. Gotta stick with your studs.

Chargers 31 Chiefs 13 Final.
Welcome to Football Follies, Chiefs edition.
Shaun Draughn just tied Jamaal Charles for the Chiefs rushing TD lead with 2. Matt Cassel has the only other TD run for KC all season.
The Chargers defense scores its 2nd straight TD. When it rains it pours for the Chiefs who have yet to hold a regulation lead this season.
There have been 33 passes and 33 runs so far between the Chargers and Chiefs after that Charles burst.
Over #kcchiefs last seven quarters Jamaal Charles has 13 rushing yards on 11 carries. #whatsgoingonwithplaycalling
Chargers go up 10-0 on a Nick Novak FG.

Third TD of the Year for Antonio Gates. He hasn't had fewer than seven since his rookie season.
Very impressive pre-game festivities in San Diego featuring U.S. service men, women and treasure. #flyover #patriotic
The last 100-yard rushing games for SD vs. KC were LaDainian Tomlinson's twice in 2007, two of 22 such games for SD vs. KC.
The last Chief to rush for 100 yards in a game against SD was Larry Johnson in 2006. Has only happened 15 times.
The #KCChiefs are 52-51-1 against the #Chargers alltime including the AFL and 42-42 since both joined the NFL.

If Dez Bryant's fingertip had hit an inch inside the white paint he would've been the hero and Romo would've been hailed as clutch. #cruel
@seshen Longest 10 seconds ever.
The NFL is a league of inches. Dez Bryant's hand was out of bounds. 6 seconds to go for Dallas trailing NYG by 5. 3rd & 6.
The play is under review.
OAK closed out KC 26-16 sending KC to a 6th defeat, 4th at home. As NFL RedZone pointed out, KC has not led any game. only W was on OT kick.
@TerrazasManny  Not that I know. They've just gone away from him in favor of passes to McCluster. Bizarre.
24 unanswered points. Romo to John Phillips TD erases the Giants lead and the XP puts Dallas in front for the first time today. 24-23.
@AlbanyHDTV I still have Demaryius Thomas to go so it's not over yet.
@BMoreRaven33 @SI_DavidSabino No consistency at all. Has talent but team is one-dimensional. Flex vs. easy opponents only.
Send your fantasy questions to our fantasy roundtable @SI_DavidSabino for a chance to have it answered in an upcoming column.
JPP for the Pick 6 TD. Giants 23 Cowboys 0.
@49ersForTheWin Willis, Bowman. There are plenty. Comment was pro-Jennings, not anti anyone else.
Plenty of good candidates for DPOY. Watt is leader. Jennings (6 picks) now also in the discussion  (w/Matthews, Tillman, etc.).
Tim Jennings joined JJ Watt squarely in the race for NFL defensive player of the year.
Zach Miller's first Seahawks TD silences Ford Field.
If the Packers can't hold on against the Jags at Lambeau it will be as bad if not worse than the "referee" loss in Seattle.
Dolphins defense and special teams have dominated the Jets. MIA hasn't beaten NYJ by >7 pts. in NJ since 2003, �14 since 1990.
And Megatron makes a catch...ties Whimper, Michael Hoomanawanui and Ben Hartsock for the day.
Guy Whimper has more receptions than Calvin Johnson today.
@BMoreRaven33 In an already suspect passing game he's dropped way behind Josh Gordon. Can't see a scenario I would confidently use him in.
Tremendous play by the Titans special teams on a blocked kick at the end of the first half in Nashville.
TD Louis Murphy,  just the way the Panthers drew it up.
The Panthers D looked like they were playing flag football on that Matt Forte scoring run.
Chris Givens 50-yard TD from Sam Bradford gives Rams a 7-0 lead over NE.

Re: Giants HR Q: It's last in the ENTIRE MAJOR LEAGUES.
@MikeinMillstadt The first guess is right.
The #KCChiefs gain 5.6 yards per first-down carry, best in the NFL. The #Steelers are last with 2.94 yards per first-down run.
#SFGiants are one game from winning the World Series. They finished last in '12 HRs with 103. What 3 teams were last in HR but won Series?
@AlbanyHDTV Not a big deal. I have plenty of depth.
@Nateburch63 I prefer Bradshaw.
@BMoreRaven33 @SI_DavidSabino Crabtree but both need an upgrade at this point.
@seth_shap Ben for both.

@d_browning18 See what Brown can do for you.
Maurice Jones-Drew, Jordy Nelson, Rashard Mendenhall, Isaac Redman, Danny Amendola all INCATIVE today.
@seth_shap Brown is expected to play so he's the better of iffy choices.
@jageneta Only way to play it safe is Keller but if you can get one of the Broncos/Cards TEs of David Thomas you can gamble on Graham.

Sergio Romo closes out a Bumgarner win as the #SFGiants head back to Detroit leading the #WorldSeries two games to none.
Jared Allen is a man possessed right now.
RT if you think Percy Harvin is the most exciting player in the #NFL. #VikingsFootball
Adrian Peterson breaks off a 64-yard touchdown run off the right side. He now has 122 yards on the day.
Martin is the first player to run for over 100 yards in the 1st half against Minnesota since Shaun Alexander in 2002.
If you didn't know about Doug Martin before, you will now. 64-yard TD reception and run.
Freeney forced 43 fumbles but only recovered three in his career. The active leader in recoveries of opposition fumbles: Ray Lewis (19)
Doug Martin has 106 rushing yards on 14 carries in the first half. 20-10 TB
@jacobga12 you got it!
The correct answer is Dwight Freeney who has forced 43 fumbles in his 11 NFL seasons. John Abraham is next with 41 fumbles forced.
@AWilensky24 Correct!
@SeanMJohnson Second.
Nobody mentioned Julius Peppers who is fourth. Or Robert Mathis in third.
Lots of Ray Lewis guesses. He's tied for 16th with 19.
@JimmyOldham23 correct!
Nobody has it yet. Most forced fumbles among active NFL players.
Since the start of '10 Mike Williams has more TD catches (18) than Larry Fitzgerald (17). tied for 14th w/ Welker, L. Moore, Austin, Maclin.
That was Ronde Barber's 16th career forced fumble. Who has the most among active players?
Josh Freeman may want to roll away from Brian Robison's side (3 knocked down passes).
Touchdown Ponder to Percy Harvin and just like that the Vikings are back in the game.
TD Freeman to Erik Lorig. 10-0 Tampa Bay.
Minnesota's offense has gained 16 yards on its first three possessions. Adrian Peterson has 17 rushing yards. Not a typo.
Bucs take a 3-0 lead on the Vikes in a game that if it keeps going like this will send many viewers over to the #WorldSeries.

One hour until the Cardinals and Giants face off in Game 6 of the NLCS. Will the series end tonight or go the distance?
That's two touchdowns from Brady to Gronkowski today. This one was much easier than the first. NE 23-13.
Good effort by Denarius Moore to reach into the end zone. TD Raiders.
MJD in street clothes and on crutches along the Jaguars sideline. Left foot injury, severity TBD.
The Raiders offense is no way devoid of talent, in fact it's quite the opposite, but when they line up as a unit it's hard to tell.

@mgugs46 I'd keep him in there. Roethlisberger's grumblings plus Bengals secondary should = good game for Brown.
@TYinUTAH @SI_DavidSabino TY Hilton.
@deafjeffm I'd sit Ballard.
@BurgerisaKeeper @SI_DavidSabino Felix.
@damiansmith0812 Cook. Finley has fallen off badly of late.
@EricMason4 RG3 because of his running.
@mgugs46 Blount-Hardesty. Woodhead decent since Pats RBs are thin today and vs old team but I like the others better.
@LynnKupfer Martin/Ridley
@DS_213 Very hard to trust. I'd look elsewhere.
@nastaiger Felix
@parfornick Colston.
@Kastman4 Wright, Morris and Greene.
@paydawg @SI_DavidSabino Denver's off so Tamme's out. Maybe Keller makes an appearance on the stats sheet.
@coachruda I like Martin and Washington.
@philipleone @SI_DavidSabino I don't trust Dwyer. Has done nothing all year. Was healthy scratch last week. If PPR can use Peerman
@qbkilla76 RG3 based on running ability.
@bugler54 @SI_DavidSabino Kickers are a crapshoot but I'd go with Nugent.
@wilkentj Should have easier time this week not having to concentrate solely on pass-blocking
@SportsIsLife_23 He's been great but I'd have to sit Rudy.
@BarelyRegal Ben and Gordon.
@Mgodsey2011 Peerman coming off of great game and BJGE disappointing. It's a gamble but PPR gives Peerman the edge.
@dwmiller1412 Fitz and Cobb
@WillSmiththe2nd Yes. He's running well and the team is phasing out SJax.
@mgugs46 I like both Tanner and Blount this week better than Woodhead.
@AdamWeigle No reason he shouldn't. In light of Big Ben's recent comments I'd look for more deep shots for he and Wallace.
@WestonWilcoxon @SI_DavidSabino Yes. Leading the league in yards per carry.
@McBeth88 I'd sit Bush.
@Chest_Rockwell7 Good luck.
@KGsDADDY11 @SI_DavidSabino Gordon
@Zach_Anderson40 Bradshaw.
@MarkyMark2_0 @SI_DavidSabino I don't trust DHB yet. Ogletree ready to break out again. I like Gordon too but go with DAL
@bugler54 @SI_DavidSabino I'd sit Green
@trainwreck00 Such a tough call. I'd have to side with Romo based on the defenses but always risky.
@BurgerisaKeeper @SI_DavidSabino Felix
@Chest_Rockwell7 I prefer Moore.
@wuratm Williams is on a roll and I'd use him in a favorable matchup.
@philipleone @SI_DavidSabino @EricMackFantasy Batch and Allen.
@jmoralez714 @SI_DavidSabino Sorry. Fred.
@somoge17 Luck at home vs. Cleveland.
@SmeeginLegan Greene and Dalton.
@DS_213 Cobb's a solid play today.
@LeeBremer I'd use Brown who should get some touches when Bradshaw needs a breather.
@BornNbredSooner Gordon.
@sirsharkey Ballard and Dwyer have shown nothing. I'd use Bennett.
@drjem5 @SI_DavidSabino RG3 has answered every challenge so far and his running puts him a hair ahead.
@LynnKupfer I'd sit DeA and use Richardson and Tate.
@a_kowalsky @SI_DavidSabino The two Giants are the safest picks. The Redskins give up a lot of points.
@WestonWilcoxon @SI_DavidSabino CJ too streaky. I'd use Spiller.
@Boomerseven @SI_DavidSabino I'd sit Leshoure vs. the very tough Bears.
@wcf8089 Ridley is a solid play anyhow especially vs. Jets and with Bolden out.
@jmoralez714 @SI_DavidSabino I'd go with Jackson given those choices.
@a_kowalsky @SI_DavidSabino Solid depth there. I'd use Bradshaw.
@WillSmiththe2nd Depends on who's available.
@mgugs46 I like Hernandez and would sit Tate.
@TerrazasManny Yes. Bradshaw will start according to multiple reports.
@wilkentj Dez. Smith slumping pre-bye and Pokes DBs are tough.

@yvoids18 What are some options?
Oregon 8, Arizona State 7 with just 1:12 gone in the first quarter.
That's two crucial drops by the Seahawks, Turbin and Moore. Good throws by Wilson on both.
Kendall Hunter entered tonight's game as the third-leading rusher in terms of yards per carry, behind only C.J. Spiller and RGIII.
This is the first time since 1948 that the Yankees won't win the World Series in a year the Kentucky Wildcats won the NCAA basketball title.

@marino74 1 for 2 with 2 BB
Tigers 3, Yankees 0. Tigers lead ALCS 2-0.
Redskins rookie backfield has combined for 918 rushing yards and 11 TDs this season. #nomoreshanahanigans
Tom Brady's 58 attempts were a career-high but fourth most in Pats history. Drew Bledsoe (70, 60) and Steve Grogan (59) had more.
If the Bills can pull out this game in the desert the entire AFC East would be 3-3.
The Seahawks stop Brady, Welker and the Patriots on 4th down and take over with 53 seconds left. Seattle 24, New England 23. #12thman
Seahawks have the Patriots on the ropes with 1:14 remaining. The 12th man in full effect.
RG3 has 139 yards rushing and two TDs today following his 76-yard scamper. His 182 passing yards with a TD/INT seem like an afterthought.
Jay Feely kicks a 61-yard FG to tie the Bills at 16. That's right, a 61-yard FG from Jay Feely. #kickersdialinglongdistance

And with minimum 5 NFL games played it's Victor Cruz who started today with an 82.3 ypg average.
It's today's leading (well, tied) receiver Calvin Johnson with 79.4 yards per game. For those with over 100 games played it's Andre Johnson.
@DavidBassily Correct. If it's 100 games its someone else.
@bgilmer80 Yes if qualifier is over 100 games. Not if it's lower.
@A_Garry Nope
@kobie173 say 50.
Did I mention it's not Jerry Rice?
In his 14th season Randy Moss just became the 4th player with 15,000 receiving yards. He ranks 11th in receiving yards per game. Who's 1st?
Redskins Madieu Williams picks off Ponder, zig-zags his way to the pylon for a 24-yard TD.
Tigers take a 1-0 lead on a fielder's choice grounder by Delmon Young that Robinson Cano failed to turn the double play on.
RG3 joins Alfred Morris as rookies with 5 rushing TDs this season.
@mrurbz NFL Films.
With so much pressure on him all the time Kevin Kolb is starting to look like Fran Tarkenton circa 1963.
In the ALCS  Thru 5 1/2 it's scoreless. Kuroda 1 hit allowed, 8 Ks, Sanchez  3 hits allowed, 5Ks.
TD Alfred Morris, his 5th of the year.
Through 6g Greg Zuerlein has tried six 50+yard FGs, made 4. The most 50+ attempts in a season is 11 (3x) and makes is 8 (Morten Andersen)
Jason Hanson's kick gives the Lions a second win.
Tony Scheffler has come up big late in this one. Two huge catches.
Lions ball at midfield after Stefan Logan fumbles then recovers the punt return.
Lions D-Line not looking overrated on those last two plays.
Lions and Eagles tied at 23 with 3 ticks to go.
Dangerous plays by the Lions.
Hasn't Calvin Johnson been involved in more close and controversial plays the past few years than any other receiver?
Great 46-yard catch and run for Brady to Wes Welker TD.

Dan Bailey's 51-yard FG goes wide left. Ravens survive.
Dallas is alive: Recovered onside kick.
Pass hits Bryant in the chest and goes incomplete. Ravens up 2 with 32 seconds to go.
Romo to Dez Bryant leaves Cowboys 2-pt conversion shy of a tie.
@SwampJankins He's going to make one like that one of these days.
@ConroyDonkong first 3 correct...last two, not.
Miami wins as Zuerlein's 66-yard FG try goes wide left.
If Zuerlein makes this one...
one-armed circus catch by Brandon Gibson in crunch-time down three against Miami.
The #Falcons remain NFC's only undefeated team. 6-0. AFC's undefeated team the #Texans coming up tonight.
@AlbanyHDTV Yup. No targets. No reports of injury.
Move from SD to TB has been no problem. This is the 1st time Vincent Jackson has 4 receiving TDs through his team's first 5 games.
Asante Samuel's 79-yard Pick-6 was his 47th career INT breaking a tie with Ronde Barber who earlier had a 78-yard pick 6 for his 46th INT
@TerrazasManny No reports of an injury.
After review, the pee wee play resulted in a KC touchdown after all.
Today's is just the second 3-INT game of Matt Ryan's 70-game career (including the playoffs).
@mham91 Research pays off.
A Chiefs punt block just turned turned int a pee wee football play. 1st and goal on the 1 for the Chiefs.
@Rogan_OReilly Not LT...only dd it once for Gang Green
@MikeH1123 3 for 5...not your 1st or fifth
@rgbrownie Got two, and two, and two...
@B_R_West yup. Top guy with 8
@DMinformation Top guy with 8
@rockmole Got one.
Shonn Greene is the 6th Jets rusher with multiple career 100-yard, 2 TD games. Can you name the other 5?
Redskins WR Pierre Garcon is INACTIVE today
Ronde Barber's 45th interception and 8th TD is the most bizarre. Ball popped up to him off of players laying on the ground. Ran 78 yards TD
Mike Williams became the first Bucs receiver with 100-yards in the first half since Antonio Bryant in 2008.
Bad day for DB:. Morris Claiborne and Lardarius Webb are both injured in the Ravens-Cowboys game.
And now the Lions have a pick too, Louis Delmas grams an errant Michael Vick throw.
Shonn Greene is making a statement: 11 carries, 63 yards 1 TD.
TB TD for Mike Williams from Josh Freeman and TD Mark Sanchez to Stephen Hill for the Jets.
Waivers alert: Rams WR Chris Givens already had 3 catches for 85 yards serving as Danny Amendola's replacement.
Matt Ryan and Tony Romo seem to be impersonating each other today.
Jermaine Gresham rambles into the end zone on a 55-yard completion from Andy Dalton for the first touchdown of the day.
Greg the Leg Zuerlein nails a 48-yard 'Chip Shot' to give the rams a lead over Miami.
Raiders Joselio Hanson picks off Matt Ryan for Oakland's first INT of the season. The only other team without one is DET (facing Vick).
Kickoffs about to begin. Good luck to all fantasy players.
When last they met: http://t.co/IOVNiADc
@paligap914 Thanks. Good luck.
@paligap914 Boldin but neither a great play.
@RaulCamarena Gibson is safer. Nicks bigger upside. I like upside.
@Mgodsey2011 @SI_DavidSabino Ballard will get the carries with the best matchup. He's who I'd use.
@FreshkidRuben Nicks? Won't know for sure for three hours or so but probably yes.
@Johnny__Brooks Anyone who reads my column knows I'm a big Morris supporter but I'd go with Richardson this week.
@yarden_a Limited practices and tough D. I wouldn't unless no other decent alternatives.
@DSoftheForce I'm expecting Martin to have a very good game. No idea how DHB will respond to first action back from concussion.
@Klutch15 @SI_DavidSabino Celek
@BerMA33 @SI_DavidSabino Not much time til 1PM kickoffs.
@Boomerseven @SI_DavidSabino I like Roberts this week. But then Meachem's schedule will probably make him the choice going forward.
@sjwalton425 @SI_DavidSabino Schaub
@BerMA33 @SI_DavidSabino Nicks the best of that bunch.
@SLAB783 Meachem
@BMoreRaven33 Vick

@gene_riley Torrey.
@MNsportsfan24 I'd use Vick in a big game.
@wilkentj Same reasoning. Bennett.
@BrendanMohlerGW This week: Crabtree
@LynnKupfer Miami if scoring means a lot. Cards if turnovers count more.
@sportsfan009 That's for sure but only 2 TD passes in last three games  isn't cutting it.
@StevenWDoty Maclin.
@DSoftheForce Roberts and .....hesitation...looks for alternatives....sees none...Leshoure.
@BrendanMohlerGW Rodgers although not in a walkover.
@wilkentj TDs vs. 49ers this year: WR: 1  TE: 4 Go with Bennett.
@wilkentj Brady.
Inactives: Matt Cassel, Donald Brown, Daniel Thomas.  
Darrius Heyward-Bey is active.
@deafjeffm Chandler
@HotRod9169 Buffalo has been giving up yards/points hand over fist. Gotta go with Kolb if (big if) he can get any protection.
@deafjeffm Both super risky but I like Powell better.
@wilkentj Better than Wilson.
@BrendanHecht Miami
Sanchez, Romo and Vick appear to be in the most trouble. Not a lot of Matthew Stafford mentions, surprisingly.
@wilkentj Not high on him.
@BrendanHecht Eagles.
@BrendanHecht Yup. Great Miami-Florida State matchup today.
@wcf8089 I'd stick with Jordy.
@JAdamCochran Vick's riskier but also much more likely to have more fantasy points.

Notre Dame is undefeated after two goal-line stands. Now, they should dream bigger than a random BCS bowl. http://t.co/gW4GoWnR
The game of the day in college football: Texas A&M 59, La Tech 57.
RT @joe_sheehan: The last Yankee postseason game in which Derek Jeter didn't play was October 8, 1995.
RT @richarddeitsch: Joe Girardi said he would not play A-Rod at short. "It's been too long."
Joe Girardi says Derek Jeter has a left ankle fracture. Jeter is out for the rest of the postseason.
Yankees gave them a scare, but the Tigers take #ALCS Game 1, 6-4. http://t.co/t05q3jft #MLB
Here he is again: Raul Ibanez at the plate w/ Ichiro on first base and two outs in Bottom 11. #ALCS
RT @SethDavisHoops: Just incredible. It's why we love sports.
What is better than October baseball? Raul Ibanez's 2-run shot ties Yankees-Tigers, 4-4 in the bottom of the 9th. #ALCS
Then again, South Carolina keeps it close. TD shrinks #LSU's lead to 23-21 w/ 1:41 left. Onside kick coming. #SCARvsLSU
That should do it for #LSU: Jeremy Hill's 50-yard run gives them a 23-14 lead over South Carolina w/ 5:03 left. #SCARvsLSU
Delmon Young...gone. His solo shot boosts Tigers' lead to 3-0 in Top 8. #ALCS
Bases loaded? Not a problem for Doug Fister. He gets out of a jam, and Tigers still lead 2-0 after 6 innings. #ALCS
#LSU gets the touchdown it was looking for, leading South Carolina 10-7 early in the 3rd quarter. #SCARvsLSU
RT @SIPeteThamel: Great note. Unless you are an LSU fan. LSU has 29 straight offensive possessions in SEC play without a touchdown.

Kyle Brindza's 22-yard field goal is good for Notre Dame. Irish & Cardinal tied 13-13 w/ 20 seconds left. http://t.co/Fhf4BAZ2
The real takeaway from Oklahoma's beatdown of Texas: Mike Stoops' return has made a big impact. http://t.co/g4bNiIxJ
File under "unexpected halftime scores": Texas Tech leads #WVU, 35-7. Red Raiders QB Seth Doege has 336 yds passing & 4 TDs.
