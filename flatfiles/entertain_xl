Though it hasn't been scheduled yet, there will be a #Daredevil and #Hulk meet-up! http://t.co/08pyKvwo #MarvelNBT
Leinil wants Hulk to look slightly more human. It's somewhere between the crazy looking Hulk and the more human one. http://t.co/08pyKvwo
As for the armor-type stuff we've seen in some #Hulk shots, it's not for Hulk. It's for Banner, says @MarkWaid. http://t.co/08pyKvwo
"I want to make Hulk a little more unique again, like he was back in the day." @MarkWaid http://t.co/08pyKvwo #MarvelNBT

"Bruce Banner reaches a point in his life where he realizes the things he's been doing haven't been working." @MarkWaid http://t.co/08pyKvwo
"The #Hulk is FAST. Those are big muscles on him. Leinil captures the sense of Hulk as a force of nature." @MarkWaid http://t.co/08pyKvwo
The reasons why he is an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a mystery that will build out as the story goes on. http://t.co/08pyKvwo #MarvelNBT
The #Hulk destroys and Banner builds. Banner will be spending his time and energy making up for what the Hulk does. http://t.co/08pyKvwo
"#BruceBanner has decided to take a bit of a sabbatical from worrying about trying to control the #Hulk." @MarkWaid http://t.co/08pyKvwo

It's a Thor book, so certainly at some point you'll see #Loki. But for now, Loki is in #YoungAvengers. http://t.co/K8dXPAtx #MarvelNBT
Future Thor more removed time-wise from present day Thor than present Thor is from past Thor. http://t.co/K8dXPAtx #MarvelNBT
"There's lots of mead drinking and hitting things with hammers in this book." Jason Aaron http://t.co/K8dXPAtx #MarvelNBT
"Thor's probably forgotten more stories than we've told!" Lauren Sankovitch http://t.co/K8dXPAtx #MarvelNBT
Jason Aaron wanted to strip away the supporting cast for a bit, but  Warriors Three and Sif will return! http://t.co/K8dXPAtx #MarvelNBT
Jason Aaron says that's one of his favorite things to write so far, that first person narration. http://t.co/K8dXPAtx #MarvelNBT
Thor is narrating the story throughout, so you get inside the thoughts of each Thor--past, present and future. http://t.co/K8dXPAtx
"There's nothing you'll have to read to jump right into this series." Marc Strom http://t.co/K8dXPAtx #MarvelNBT
There's a story as to how & why #Thor lost his eye & his arm. http://t.co/K8dXPAtx When he goes into battle, he wears the  #Destroyer's arm!
Esad Ribic says the way Jason's writing these characters, they are so fresh that he's imagining them as new characters. http://t.co/K8dXPAtx
In the Stan Lee & Jack Kirby tales, you saw #Thor before his hammer, & that was where Jason Aaron wanted to return to. http://t.co/K8dXPAtx
Stringing the three stories together will be one new villain, a serial killer of the gods, according to Jason Aaron. http://t.co/K8dXPAtx
Past-Thor is fighting with the vikings, present day Thor is on cosmic adventures, & King Thor is the last Asgardian god http://t.co/K8dXPAtx
"In the book, we focus on three different Thors: one in the past, one in the present, and one in the future"Jason Aaron http://t.co/K8dXPAtx

"Avengers #1 starts with a big bang. Then we proceed from there." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ #MarvelNBT
"Black Panther is certainly the moral center of New Avengers." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ #MarvelNBT
"Black Panther is the lynchpin character of New Avengers. The central character." @TomBrevoort http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ #MarvelNBT
"Avengers is the day book and New Avengers is night.  One book is about life, one is about death. The logos reflect all this." @JHickman
"I have a responsibility to Marvel to sell copies and a responsibility to the fans to entertain them." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ
"Cannonball & Sunspot are younger characters. It's always good to have those types of figures to bring a fresh viewpoint." @JHickman
"We need new bad guys. I'm making a lot. Will you see  traditional Avengers favorite villains? Of course." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ
"How big must the crisis be versus what happens in the Marvel Universe on an average day to bring these characters together?" @TomBrevoort
"People know from FF what a big thinker Jonathan is & how he plays the long game. It's a bigger canvas here." @TomBrevoort
"The New Avengers/Illuminati roster is Cap, Iron Man & Doctor Strange, plus Black Bolt and Namor." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ
"The books will work in tandem. You don't have to read both, but they are two sides of the same coin." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ
"The New Avengers are real world, they live in the dark, apocalyptic world as it is." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ #MarvelNBT
"The Avengers are the utopian Avengers, the ideal ones we want." @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ #MarvelNBT
"One of the first things we all agreed on is that the roster should look more like the world. " @JHickman http://t.co/6YdCWbVZ
"We see the back story of how Iron Man & Cap have been quietly building a contingency plan for the day that comes in issue #1." @JHickman
