@venunarla will look now
@venunarla have not looked
@Alloverthemap10 hmm, not sure about register part
@Alloverthemap10 agreed!
@johnstack me too.
@rocco_thestreet yep
@carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet @stills I think I was trying to say that, but he did it right
@rocco_thestreet oh that Kramer thing was very different.
@rocco_thestreet look I like both kinds. It's a matter of taste
@rocco_thestreet not sure humor should be loaded with having to do harm or good. It's a joke
@rocco_thestreet I will have to disagree. Anything can be humorous.
@stills @carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet perfect!
@rocco_thestreet well than it was an unsuccessful humor piece. But it was not meant as a thoughtful serious essay on the topic
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish well you're wrong and she was not censored. You're making a mountain out of a silly one-off essay
@carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet it's not fair to her, but it is what it is. There will be similar debate when sandberg's book comes out
@carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet also Mayer is a lighting rod for this issue right now and whatever she says is going to get chewed over
@carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet it was in no way comparable to what a true attack would have been. Too light
@rocco_thestreet all over web. That was a counter piece. The Belkin one was full of poking but really just trying to be funny
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish it was obviously even if you did not think it was funny. Read the Anne Marie slaughter piece on Sandberg
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish you might compare it to Anne Marie slaughter one on Sandberg, which was a serious one
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish it is a very nice piece and all you wrote, but her original piece was a humor piece.
@carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet of course, but it was a humor piece, not a tsk-task lecture. You clearly read into it
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish the night nurse thing was part of a joke. Why remove it? Silliness.
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish oh baby one. You know it was a humor piece
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish which?
@pammilpr @waltmossberg really clever
@sun10384 @karaswisher thx
@shervin @joshelman @allthingsd yep
@johnstack @slahde btw yahoo or people have largely been real pros over the many years and really great people
@slahde @johnstack I was teasing
@rawteach if at all
@Alloverthemap10 of course
@Alloverthemap10 is that a journalism effort?
@simeons thx!
@sawickipedia  http://t.co/6qHcEq3c
@sawickipedia oh, yes. of course. sorry
@realestaterossi @waltmossberg not sure
@ruchitgarg @waltmossberg yes, they sent it
@lostinatx i am not defensive. you called him dumb with no knowledge and I know him well and he is not.
@sawickipedia my work is me!
great piece by @mattlynley  MyHeritage Raises $25 Million, Aquires Geni - Digits - WSJ http://t.co/Rsxn7nxs
@sawickipedia oh please feel free to criticize me when I deserve it as I surely will at some point.
@lostinatx i don't work at the journal and don't agree. I broke the story in the first place about his struggles, but he's still very smart.
@Roebot @waltmossberg no, but it works here. plus: pearls.
@sawickipedia i am doing a big profile on a new exec right now and I have talked to 65 people so far and I finally have what I need.
@sawickipedia well, yes. the reality is reporting is spade work -- endless phone calls and digging
Gotta love Groupon PR's moxie, even with pressure on, in this FANTASTIC holiday mailing to me and @waltmossberg :  http://t.co/V2Qxxl1B
@lebigmatt ouch
@lostinatx he isn't tho
@sawickipedia it's just made up and it bugs me to see it.
@forwardedme missed that. thankfully
@forwardedme indeed. I can see why he would think this, but the report was based on a lot of reporting. others just foloed once it was out
@forwardedme it is more interesting if press being used at last minute, but this has been building.
@forwardedme i saw it and it was very nice. but his theory is not correct. have been tracking this rift from both sides for months.
@forwardedme we have that one

@gaberivera And along the way, bipartisan efforts like the JOBS Act ensure that the US remains the easiest place to start a tech co.
@gaberivera You're falling for a GOP rhetorical ploy. The President supports high tech immigration as one aspect of legal immigration reform
@gaberivera This approach isn't a surprise. The GOP has known this stance from day one. That's why they suddenly support tech immigration.
@gaberivera I know you aren't arguing that those companies have the overall interest of the country at heart.
@gaberivera Because punting on the undocumented worker issue makes a ton of economic sense. Turns out our country extends beyond California.
@gaberivera Thinking being if they piecemeal it one constituency at a time, that will avoid tackling the core of the undocumented problem.
@gaberivera The President's immigration stance is not new. And he has shared it consistently. Comprehensive immigration reform or bust.

@Joshmedia Hahahaha. TouchŽ. Hugs. I love you. And I wish safety for Israel and Palestine. Happy Thanksgiving!
@Joshmedia Wait, that sounds familiar. Which other people were promised a state? Dude, why waste breath defending terrorists? I don't.
@Joshmedia Btw, if you look back, my first Tweet on this subject said that Israeli leadership was out of step with their citizenry.
@Joshmedia And, the important part, their terror campaigns worked. Public pressure back home forced the British government's hand.
@Joshmedia They were rival factions who collaborated at one point until the Haganah sabotaged the others. Terrorists nonetheless.
@Joshmedia Did they not commit acts of terror and kidnapping to drive out the British? Can we at least establish that? It's not disputed.
@Joshmedia Check out the Irgun and Lehi groups. Bombed trains, train stations, and hotels to drive out the Brits. Seriously though, dinner.

@john_frankel John, apparently you're not reading my Tweets.
@Joshmedia Where did I oversimplify? No historian would dispute that the Haganah used terrorist tactics. Anyway, time for dinner. Hugs.
@john_frankel What about the billions in aid to the Israelis? To support a military that denies basic human rights to an entire nation.
@john_frankel Maybe Israel could remove a blockade and stop destroying infrastructure and we would find out. Absurd argument.
@Joshmedia Hamas is evil. But Israel's approach isn't working. Allowing a standard of living in Palestine would defang the terrorists.
@Joshmedia ... the high road by consistently violating UN resolutions and unilaterally expanding territory. So, in summary...
@Joshmedia When a people have nothing to lose, they tend to act like they have nothing to lose. 4) Israel doesn't even allow themselves...
@Joshmedia All they manage to do is strengthen the resolve of the resistance. And why? Because Palestinians have been denied basic rights.
@Joshmedia ... exist but for acts of terror committed against British civilians. 3) Israel's current approach frankly isn't working.
@Joshmedia 1) You've never seen me defend Hamas. 2) During the Haganah era, Zionists used terrorism quite effectively. Israel wouldn't...

@fromedome @hunterwalk @omid it is like minority report, except department of pre-messaging
@MPandya would certainly say what didnÕt happen in New York doesnÕt amount to media innovation in eyes of @cjr, others
@MPandya blog post might be a better option for me to explain.
@hunterwalk @cap first of all it is what happens in all industries. You suck, you get shown the door. Example, what happened with TapJoy
@cap @hunterwalk it is the meme of the week. Being doing it all my life, so not sure what u guys talking about :)
@hunterwalk it is s lot more focus on shipping the quality stuff (keeping with brand values) and has nothing about being risk averse @cap
@hunterwalk or maybe he and the other fired guy were responsible for Maps debacle. Of course, you might be right too
The post industrial journalism report by @cjr has a distinctly east coast bias. No surprised, but expected more from @cshirky
@hunterwalk any insights into his abilities to get things done, maps. I know a lot of smart guys who well are not really smart in realworld

AMD will challenge Intel with ARM-based server chips. InÊ2014. by @gigastacey http://t.co/Hw9k1ftC
@alexismadrigal it is bit of that. it might also be that Òover promisingÓ was an issue. Siri, Maps. J other stuff.
I like Tim Cook - he doesnÕt muck about - do your job, do it well and get rich. Or else get the hell out of cupertino. eg Forstall, Browett
John Browett head of retail is leaving Apple $AAPL. DonÕt let the door hit ya on the way out. Again, not a bad move.
Scott Forstall out at $AAPL. It is not such a bad thing.
in first twenty minutes, $AMD CEO has used up all the buzzwords that can be used. Not that there is anything wrong with it.
dear @amd stop using Thomson ReutersÕ cheap video for streaming your most ÒimportantÓ ÒmajorÓ news announcement.

.@LivingSocial has sold 176,864 @McDonalds deals or 919,692,800 calories or 262,769lbs of body fat. (3,500 per lb) - #livingfat

Now on Samsung's utility patent claims: has it shown Apple infringed them? No, no, no, no. Terrible day in court for Samsung's lawyers.
Jury awards $1.5bn damages for Galaxy Tab infringements. Ouch. That's gotta hurt back at Samsung.
Jury determines that Apple's "utility" patents (how interface works) weren't shown invalid by Samsung #icourt #appsung
Good news for Samsung: its tablets not found to have looked like iPad copies ("trade dress"). Jury all "no" there.
Trade dress: lots of Samsung phones determined to have infringed. Not looking good at all for Samsung. #icourt #appsung
Yes to infringement on Apple patent relating to tap-to-zoom and "rubber band" on scrolling lists. But: are the patens valid?
Apple wins claims against Samsung on utility patents. Bad for Samsung #icourt #appsung
Phew. Jury has entered the Apple/Samsung court. Worried they were lost like band in Spinal Tap.
Which you have to admit, is a high probability. #icourt #appsung

@ocdgirl2000 there's nothing worse than feeling helpless with a sick child. And it seems wrong to have to job-shop because of it.
@ocdgirl2000 in recent years I believe you are right. But in the old days, that wasn't the case. Now it's the law, which is good.
@ShtickWithShell in old days, changing ins cos was a risk, and a brand new startup doesn't have insurance on day one.
@texaszman and, no amount of salary offered could make him risk losing coverage for his child.
@texaszman actually, startups under 50 ppl get a tax rebate under the law to help offer insurance to employees.
@ocdgirl2000 we provided insurance to all employees, but couldn't force them to cover pre-existing conditions.
@ocdgirl2000 insurance companies all denied coverage of pre-existing conditions, so changing jobs meant his child would lose coverage.
Once, I couldn't recruit someone b/c he was afraid of losing insurance for sick child. Nothing I could do. No more. #hcr

@MaharbaR just put one up on Facebook, friend.
@mikebaz we're wondering if Twitter wasn't just tired of us too.
We're pretty proud. @wootlive found out the limit is 1000 tweets a day. They've been shut down so Apple may as well stop now.
Alright! Something for everyone to look forward to! RT @WootLive: New Nano means we'll have something fun to sell in 2013!
@Josephus01 hey, they warned you!
@CferMN both testicles or a leg, whichever you think he can most spare.
Any guesses on the iPhone 5? RT @WootLive: (start placing your bets for price)
@coraphise I'll give you $5 to go sue Apple.
RT @WootLive: #Apple just announced iCal showing FIVE WHOLE DAYS of your week as an innovative new feature.
We'll be covering the Apple stuff today over on @wootlive if you want a completely, totally unbiased take on the announcements!
@zeeeter no idea if we even have any more, honestly! Keep an eye out during a Woot-Off, that's where they'd be if we do.
@couchegrass have you already emailed into service@woot.com? They should be able to help you there.

@claystorm totally the first thing on our list right now! The cruel and unusual punishment of leaving us feedback.
@natums we're a little in that phase too, but prodding at it will only make it stronger.
@joshsherick to my knowledge: no. But my knowledge there is limited still.
@jonrosenberg excellent! They were overwhelming to me at first, wondering what others are thinking.
@jonrosenberg understood. Are you somewhat intrigued by the new amount of sales? Or still in the learning curve of figuring them out?
@the_tim we thought that was pretty shiny!
It's Woot: The Future! Our devs put so many late nights in, you could say it's made out of pizza & caffeine. Whaddya think?
@mrsdostal no problem! A lot of people did.
@mrsdostal sorry, we mentioned way back when we launched that derby, we'd only be printing two from it.
@crossey3d here's a great big hug. And we'll check out the beta feedback button thing.
We've moved a couple things around- get used to the new site using this handy dandy guide: http://t.co/daP00lBI
@Guardian_Bob yes, we're working on unplugging and replugging right now.
@AnothrEaglesFan that just means new code is doing it's magic! If you think happy thoughts, maybe soon we'll fly!
@LeslieFiore we're soooooo close!
@jandjorgensen we will accept table flipping at any time.
@JanaLipscomb we're hoping to keep 100% of all stupid features.
@pammiemattes I don't know if I'm authorized to give an EXACT time but we hope for only a few more hours.
@JanaLipscomb we're blushing we're so flattered.
@diabeetus441 always!
@bradhawkinsyo and now you know why we couldn't possibly launch that for real without some terrible feedback.
@bradhawkinsyo http://t.co/8GGwrKMl
@petllama to be the WINNINGEST
@kitzey hopefully you'll think it's worth it!
Have you been watching the new landing pages? The Facebook sneak peeks? What are you thinking so far?
@TheOneTar there's not going to be a shirt today if that somehow eases your nerves.
@Shadowbat flip a table, PROVE YOUR DEVOTION
@tirty8 demands will get you no where! But they may scare us a little :'(
Things are still on schedule, so don't flip out that we're still down. New quiz is up: What kind of monkey are you? http://t.co/iR8B0BZ1
@austom1 :(
@syntheticjesso aww! I can promise you we will not.
@JimBurnell they prefer cookies to physical touch.
Yep, still down and will be for a while longer. Relieve boredom, chat with Wooters- join our @turntablefm room: http://t.co/LdutCJT8
@mikebbass that's a gorgeous room!
@Alan_Wolf Mortimer's actually getting a lot of pleasure from telling the devs to CODE CODE CODE CODE Monte's sipping coffee.
@jaymz9mm I think he only comes around if you say the incorrect sneak peak *fingers crossed*
Scared? Worried? We put up a new quiz so you can figure out what your reaction will be when we finally come back up: http://t.co/iR8B0BZ1
@mikebbass we're here Mike, we'll always be here.
@305_MarioSierra we've already started, though the holiday weekend could cramp our normally super-speedy style.
@devoncarrots goodnight carroty friend!
@draggingalake oh, we're really down. You can sleep, nothing interesting tonight.
@draggingalake I tried to link you to our jobs page but our site's down, what the crap's up with that!?
@Phonascus totally understandable, but at some point I'm going to go to sleep tonight, so... you may be disappointed.
@BIGELLOW OF COURSE, how else could we get it to you? DRIVE the truck? Pssh.
@draggingalake you have very convincing friends.
@BIGELLOW pretty clever, huh?
@cilution aw, man, now we can't bring up the site for another week because of you :'(
@spenceralex you could still give us some money you don't need!
@devoncarrots what are his talents?
@draggingalake WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE HEART ATTACK #error37

@NoahsDadDotCom sadly, no. I can only hope really hard we'll have another Dyson up soon for you.
@NoahsDadDotCom we seem to have 1.2 million Dysons any other day, but Woot-Offs? I really couldn't promise anything.
@jaybcruiser I'm only lashing out because I didn't get one myself :(
@jaybcruiser wait until you get the crap, that's when the real tears will start flowing.

Ballmer: Microsoft redesigned its own apps, like IE, for touch.
Steve Ballmer: "Are these new designs PCs? Yes. Are these new designs tablets? Yes."
Steve Ballmer calls #windows8 experience "magical". Where have I heard that term before from a tech CEO?
Microsoft taking pains to praise competing machines before showing its own #Surface, which will compete with them -- and get own session.
@SingleMaltShot That's dramatically higher than my sources say, at least for new-style apps that work on RT.
At #windows8 event, Julie Larson-Green, who led radical re-imagining of Windows, takes stage to show the new OS.
#windowsrt devices like #Surface only available from 5 companies -- MSFT, Dell, Asus, Lenovo & Samsung.
.@stevesi concedes #windows8 app store is "just getting started." Calls it a "grand opening". Cites no numbers.
Over 1,000 new PCs certified for #windows8, including some under $300.
.@stevesi says today is "an amazing day" for the evolution of the PC. #windows8
#windows8 is "much, much better" than Windows 7, claims @stevesi at big NY launch.

Brady, Gronk and the #pats defense put on a clinic today, making the Tebow-obsessed sports media look silly. Go Pats! #Patriots
Once again, say it with me: BRADY! Six touchdown passes with like 26 min.left. Ties the full-game record! #Pats

#OWS doesn't win by proposing a better compromise. They win by subjecting the current one to disintegrating pressure.
The message of #OWS is not "Here's is our 9-point plan." The message of #OWS is "This is not a livable compromise."
Groups of voters have incompatible goals, so working democracy doesn't produce coherent policies, but livable compromises.
People complaining that #OWS don't have coherent demands haven't noticed that US response to the crisis isn't coherent either.
