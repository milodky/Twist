@venunarla will look now
@venunarla have not looked
@Alloverthemap10 hmm, not sure about register part
@Alloverthemap10 agreed!
@johnstack me too.
@rocco_thestreet yep
@carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet @stills I think I was trying to say that, but he did it right
@rocco_thestreet oh that Kramer thing was very different.
@rocco_thestreet look I like both kinds. It's a matter of taste
@rocco_thestreet not sure humor should be loaded with having to do harm or good. It's a joke
@rocco_thestreet I will have to disagree. Anything can be humorous.
@stills @carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet perfect!
@rocco_thestreet well than it was an unsuccessful humor piece. But it was not meant as a thoughtful serious essay on the topic
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish well you're wrong and she was not censored. You're making a mountain out of a silly one-off essay
@carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet it's not fair to her, but it is what it is. There will be similar debate when sandberg's book comes out
@carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet also Mayer is a lighting rod for this issue right now and whatever she says is going to get chewed over
@carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet it was in no way comparable to what a true attack would have been. Too light
@rocco_thestreet all over web. That was a counter piece. The Belkin one was full of poking but really just trying to be funny
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish it was obviously even if you did not think it was funny. Read the Anne Marie slaughter piece on Sandberg
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish you might compare it to Anne Marie slaughter one on Sandberg, which was a serious one
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish it is a very nice piece and all you wrote, but her original piece was a humor piece.
@carletonenglish @rocco_thestreet of course, but it was a humor piece, not a tsk-task lecture. You clearly read into it
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish the night nurse thing was part of a joke. Why remove it? Silliness.
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish oh baby one. You know it was a humor piece
@rocco_thestreet @carletonenglish which?
@pammilpr @waltmossberg really clever
@sun10384 @karaswisher thx
@shervin @joshelman @allthingsd yep
@johnstack @slahde btw yahoo or people have largely been real pros over the many years and really great people
@slahde @johnstack I was teasing
@rawteach if at all
@Alloverthemap10 of course
@Alloverthemap10 is that a journalism effort?
@simeons thx!
@sawickipedia  http://t.co/6qHcEq3c
@sawickipedia oh, yes. of course. sorry
@realestaterossi @waltmossberg not sure
@ruchitgarg @waltmossberg yes, they sent it
@lostinatx i am not defensive. you called him dumb with no knowledge and I know him well and he is not.
@sawickipedia my work is me!
great piece by @mattlynley  MyHeritage Raises $25 Million, Aquires Geni - Digits - WSJ http://t.co/Rsxn7nxs
@sawickipedia oh please feel free to criticize me when I deserve it as I surely will at some point.
@lostinatx i don't work at the journal and don't agree. I broke the story in the first place about his struggles, but he's still very smart.
@Roebot @waltmossberg no, but it works here. plus: pearls.
@sawickipedia i am doing a big profile on a new exec right now and I have talked to 65 people so far and I finally have what I need.
@sawickipedia well, yes. the reality is reporting is spade work -- endless phone calls and digging
Gotta love Groupon PR's moxie, even with pressure on, in this FANTASTIC holiday mailing to me and @waltmossberg :  http://t.co/V2Qxxl1B
@lebigmatt ouch
@lostinatx he isn't tho
@sawickipedia it's just made up and it bugs me to see it.
@forwardedme missed that. thankfully
@forwardedme indeed. I can see why he would think this, but the report was based on a lot of reporting. others just foloed once it was out
@forwardedme it is more interesting if press being used at last minute, but this has been building.
@forwardedme i saw it and it was very nice. but his theory is not correct. have been tracking this rift from both sides for months.
@forwardedme we have that one

@gaberivera And along the way, bipartisan efforts like the JOBS Act ensure that the US remains the easiest place to start a tech co.
@gaberivera You're falling for a GOP rhetorical ploy. The President supports high tech immigration as one aspect of legal immigration reform
@gaberivera This approach isn't a surprise. The GOP has known this stance from day one. That's why they suddenly support tech immigration.
@gaberivera I know you aren't arguing that those companies have the overall interest of the country at heart.
@gaberivera Because punting on the undocumented worker issue makes a ton of economic sense. Turns out our country extends beyond California.
@gaberivera Thinking being if they piecemeal it one constituency at a time, that will avoid tackling the core of the undocumented problem.
@gaberivera The President's immigration stance is not new. And he has shared it consistently. Comprehensive immigration reform or bust.

@Joshmedia Hahahaha. TouchŽ. Hugs. I love you. And I wish safety for Israel and Palestine. Happy Thanksgiving!
@Joshmedia Wait, that sounds familiar. Which other people were promised a state? Dude, why waste breath defending terrorists? I don't.
@Joshmedia Btw, if you look back, my first Tweet on this subject said that Israeli leadership was out of step with their citizenry.
@Joshmedia And, the important part, their terror campaigns worked. Public pressure back home forced the British government's hand.
@Joshmedia They were rival factions who collaborated at one point until the Haganah sabotaged the others. Terrorists nonetheless.
@Joshmedia Did they not commit acts of terror and kidnapping to drive out the British? Can we at least establish that? It's not disputed.
@Joshmedia Check out the Irgun and Lehi groups. Bombed trains, train stations, and hotels to drive out the Brits. Seriously though, dinner.

@john_frankel John, apparently you're not reading my Tweets.
@Joshmedia Where did I oversimplify? No historian would dispute that the Haganah used terrorist tactics. Anyway, time for dinner. Hugs.
@john_frankel What about the billions in aid to the Israelis? To support a military that denies basic human rights to an entire nation.
@john_frankel Maybe Israel could remove a blockade and stop destroying infrastructure and we would find out. Absurd argument.
@Joshmedia Hamas is evil. But Israel's approach isn't working. Allowing a standard of living in Palestine would defang the terrorists.
@Joshmedia ... the high road by consistently violating UN resolutions and unilaterally expanding territory. So, in summary...
@Joshmedia When a people have nothing to lose, they tend to act like they have nothing to lose. 4) Israel doesn't even allow themselves...
@Joshmedia All they manage to do is strengthen the resolve of the resistance. And why? Because Palestinians have been denied basic rights.
@Joshmedia ... exist but for acts of terror committed against British civilians. 3) Israel's current approach frankly isn't working.
@Joshmedia 1) You've never seen me defend Hamas. 2) During the Haganah era, Zionists used terrorism quite effectively. Israel wouldn't...

@fromedome @hunterwalk @omid it is like minority report, except department of pre-messaging
@MPandya would certainly say what didnÕt happen in New York doesnÕt amount to media innovation in eyes of @cjr, others
@MPandya blog post might be a better option for me to explain.
@hunterwalk @cap first of all it is what happens in all industries. You suck, you get shown the door. Example, what happened with TapJoy
@cap @hunterwalk it is the meme of the week. Being doing it all my life, so not sure what u guys talking about :)
@hunterwalk it is s lot more focus on shipping the quality stuff (keeping with brand values) and has nothing about being risk averse @cap
@hunterwalk or maybe he and the other fired guy were responsible for Maps debacle. Of course, you might be right too
The post industrial journalism report by @cjr has a distinctly east coast bias. No surprised, but expected more from @cshirky
@hunterwalk any insights into his abilities to get things done, maps. I know a lot of smart guys who well are not really smart in realworld

AMD will challenge Intel with ARM-based server chips. InÊ2014. by @gigastacey http://t.co/Hw9k1ftC
@alexismadrigal it is bit of that. it might also be that Òover promisingÓ was an issue. Siri, Maps. J other stuff.
I like Tim Cook - he doesnÕt muck about - do your job, do it well and get rich. Or else get the hell out of cupertino. eg Forstall, Browett
John Browett head of retail is leaving Apple $AAPL. DonÕt let the door hit ya on the way out. Again, not a bad move.
Scott Forstall out at $AAPL. It is not such a bad thing.
in first twenty minutes, $AMD CEO has used up all the buzzwords that can be used. Not that there is anything wrong with it.
dear @amd stop using Thomson ReutersÕ cheap video for streaming your most ÒimportantÓ ÒmajorÓ news announcement.

.@LivingSocial has sold 176,864 @McDonalds deals or 919,692,800 calories or 262,769lbs of body fat. (3,500 per lb) - #livingfat

Now on Samsung's utility patent claims: has it shown Apple infringed them? No, no, no, no. Terrible day in court for Samsung's lawyers.
Jury awards $1.5bn damages for Galaxy Tab infringements. Ouch. That's gotta hurt back at Samsung.
Jury determines that Apple's "utility" patents (how interface works) weren't shown invalid by Samsung #icourt #appsung
Good news for Samsung: its tablets not found to have looked like iPad copies ("trade dress"). Jury all "no" there.
Trade dress: lots of Samsung phones determined to have infringed. Not looking good at all for Samsung. #icourt #appsung
Yes to infringement on Apple patent relating to tap-to-zoom and "rubber band" on scrolling lists. But: are the patens valid?
Apple wins claims against Samsung on utility patents. Bad for Samsung #icourt #appsung
Phew. Jury has entered the Apple/Samsung court. Worried they were lost like band in Spinal Tap.
Which you have to admit, is a high probability. #icourt #appsung

@ocdgirl2000 there's nothing worse than feeling helpless with a sick child. And it seems wrong to have to job-shop because of it.
@ocdgirl2000 in recent years I believe you are right. But in the old days, that wasn't the case. Now it's the law, which is good.
@ShtickWithShell in old days, changing ins cos was a risk, and a brand new startup doesn't have insurance on day one.
@texaszman and, no amount of salary offered could make him risk losing coverage for his child.
@texaszman actually, startups under 50 ppl get a tax rebate under the law to help offer insurance to employees.
@ocdgirl2000 we provided insurance to all employees, but couldn't force them to cover pre-existing conditions.
@ocdgirl2000 insurance companies all denied coverage of pre-existing conditions, so changing jobs meant his child would lose coverage.
Once, I couldn't recruit someone b/c he was afraid of losing insurance for sick child. Nothing I could do. No more. #hcr

@MaharbaR just put one up on Facebook, friend.
@mikebaz we're wondering if Twitter wasn't just tired of us too.
We're pretty proud. @wootlive found out the limit is 1000 tweets a day. They've been shut down so Apple may as well stop now.
Alright! Something for everyone to look forward to! RT @WootLive: New Nano means we'll have something fun to sell in 2013!
@Josephus01 hey, they warned you!
@CferMN both testicles or a leg, whichever you think he can most spare.
Any guesses on the iPhone 5? RT @WootLive: (start placing your bets for price)
@coraphise I'll give you $5 to go sue Apple.
RT @WootLive: #Apple just announced iCal showing FIVE WHOLE DAYS of your week as an innovative new feature.
We'll be covering the Apple stuff today over on @wootlive if you want a completely, totally unbiased take on the announcements!
@zeeeter no idea if we even have any more, honestly! Keep an eye out during a Woot-Off, that's where they'd be if we do.
@couchegrass have you already emailed into service@woot.com? They should be able to help you there.

@claystorm totally the first thing on our list right now! The cruel and unusual punishment of leaving us feedback.
@natums we're a little in that phase too, but prodding at it will only make it stronger.
@joshsherick to my knowledge: no. But my knowledge there is limited still.
@jonrosenberg excellent! They were overwhelming to me at first, wondering what others are thinking.
@jonrosenberg understood. Are you somewhat intrigued by the new amount of sales? Or still in the learning curve of figuring them out?
@the_tim we thought that was pretty shiny!
It's Woot: The Future! Our devs put so many late nights in, you could say it's made out of pizza & caffeine. Whaddya think?
@mrsdostal no problem! A lot of people did.
@mrsdostal sorry, we mentioned way back when we launched that derby, we'd only be printing two from it.
@crossey3d here's a great big hug. And we'll check out the beta feedback button thing.
We've moved a couple things around- get used to the new site using this handy dandy guide: http://t.co/daP00lBI
@Guardian_Bob yes, we're working on unplugging and replugging right now.
@AnothrEaglesFan that just means new code is doing it's magic! If you think happy thoughts, maybe soon we'll fly!
@LeslieFiore we're soooooo close!
@jandjorgensen we will accept table flipping at any time.
@JanaLipscomb we're hoping to keep 100% of all stupid features.
@pammiemattes I don't know if I'm authorized to give an EXACT time but we hope for only a few more hours.
@JanaLipscomb we're blushing we're so flattered.
@diabeetus441 always!
@bradhawkinsyo and now you know why we couldn't possibly launch that for real without some terrible feedback.
@bradhawkinsyo http://t.co/8GGwrKMl
@petllama to be the WINNINGEST
@kitzey hopefully you'll think it's worth it!
Have you been watching the new landing pages? The Facebook sneak peeks? What are you thinking so far?
@TheOneTar there's not going to be a shirt today if that somehow eases your nerves.
@Shadowbat flip a table, PROVE YOUR DEVOTION
@tirty8 demands will get you no where! But they may scare us a little :'(
Things are still on schedule, so don't flip out that we're still down. New quiz is up: What kind of monkey are you? http://t.co/iR8B0BZ1
@austom1 :(
@syntheticjesso aww! I can promise you we will not.
@JimBurnell they prefer cookies to physical touch.
Yep, still down and will be for a while longer. Relieve boredom, chat with Wooters- join our @turntablefm room: http://t.co/LdutCJT8
@mikebbass that's a gorgeous room!
@Alan_Wolf Mortimer's actually getting a lot of pleasure from telling the devs to CODE CODE CODE CODE Monte's sipping coffee.
@jaymz9mm I think he only comes around if you say the incorrect sneak peak *fingers crossed*
Scared? Worried? We put up a new quiz so you can figure out what your reaction will be when we finally come back up: http://t.co/iR8B0BZ1
@mikebbass we're here Mike, we'll always be here.
@305_MarioSierra we've already started, though the holiday weekend could cramp our normally super-speedy style.
@devoncarrots goodnight carroty friend!
@draggingalake oh, we're really down. You can sleep, nothing interesting tonight.
@draggingalake I tried to link you to our jobs page but our site's down, what the crap's up with that!?
@Phonascus totally understandable, but at some point I'm going to go to sleep tonight, so... you may be disappointed.
@BIGELLOW OF COURSE, how else could we get it to you? DRIVE the truck? Pssh.
@draggingalake you have very convincing friends.
@BIGELLOW pretty clever, huh?
@cilution aw, man, now we can't bring up the site for another week because of you :'(
@spenceralex you could still give us some money you don't need!
@devoncarrots what are his talents?
@draggingalake WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE HEART ATTACK #error37

@NoahsDadDotCom sadly, no. I can only hope really hard we'll have another Dyson up soon for you.
@NoahsDadDotCom we seem to have 1.2 million Dysons any other day, but Woot-Offs? I really couldn't promise anything.
@jaybcruiser I'm only lashing out because I didn't get one myself :(
@jaybcruiser wait until you get the crap, that's when the real tears will start flowing.

Ballmer: Microsoft redesigned its own apps, like IE, for touch.
Steve Ballmer: "Are these new designs PCs? Yes. Are these new designs tablets? Yes."
Steve Ballmer calls #windows8 experience "magical". Where have I heard that term before from a tech CEO?
Microsoft taking pains to praise competing machines before showing its own #Surface, which will compete with them -- and get own session.
@SingleMaltShot That's dramatically higher than my sources say, at least for new-style apps that work on RT.
At #windows8 event, Julie Larson-Green, who led radical re-imagining of Windows, takes stage to show the new OS.
#windowsrt devices like #Surface only available from 5 companies -- MSFT, Dell, Asus, Lenovo & Samsung.
.@stevesi concedes #windows8 app store is "just getting started." Calls it a "grand opening". Cites no numbers.
Over 1,000 new PCs certified for #windows8, including some under $300.
.@stevesi says today is "an amazing day" for the evolution of the PC. #windows8
#windows8 is "much, much better" than Windows 7, claims @stevesi at big NY launch.

Brady, Gronk and the #pats defense put on a clinic today, making the Tebow-obsessed sports media look silly. Go Pats! #Patriots
Once again, say it with me: BRADY! Six touchdown passes with like 26 min.left. Ties the full-game record! #Pats

#OWS doesn't win by proposing a better compromise. They win by subjecting the current one to disintegrating pressure.
The message of #OWS is not "Here's is our 9-point plan." The message of #OWS is "This is not a livable compromise."
Groups of voters have incompatible goals, so working democracy doesn't produce coherent policies, but livable compromises.
People complaining that #OWS don't have coherent demands haven't noticed that US response to the crisis isn't coherent either.

Hate is a civil toxin.
@ejgertz I agree FUD will always be a political strategy, but hate is more toxic and more dangerous that FUD and should be differentiated.
No one benefits from hate, @sivavaid. Aside from being a civil toxin, haters tend to die early from stress-related diseases.
@jeffjarvis If we can specifically focus on countering hate speech in a nonpartisan way, that is what most interests me.
@jayrosen_nyu Let's talk. Countering hate is my focus, not partisanship or politics.
@ejgertz yes but inciting hate, and hate speech, is not a partisan issue. Needs to be opposed strenuously because it is toxic.

@kjchipmunk also, please tell me you've seen both the birth certificate and the birth announcement from the local paper's microfilm archive.
@kjchipmunk Socialism, that's funny. Ever been to France? Or Germany, even? Long road b4 we're even close, and they're not even socialist.

@fanihiman95376 you're right, great NASA-inspired prgrss hr on earth... And Hubble to bring space to us... But I'm thkng about *out there.*
It is a bit depressing for a scifi fan like me to think of how little we've accomplished in our first 40y of manned exploration.
NASA should ask Dick Cheney about the missing moon landing tapes. He knows something about video tapes going missing.

@dfuerstman oops, should have read "wasn't the right policy..." Orwellian slip.
@dfuerstman I think your lenses are safe. :) And your Kindle bks too, they've decided Orwell was the right policy advisor.

@karaswisher I agreed but was surprised today to learn some journalists take a different stance; namely, not to question source of docs
HI Gov. Lingle announces she will take monthly furlough to cut costs. That must be what AK Gov. Palin was thinking.
RT @dangillmor: several folks here have asked me what i think of twitter leak publishing. basically this:  http://is.gd/1Bonn
@sjcobrien Yes, I think that's a really interesting point. Also, we are potential victims.
@davemcclure if you declare email bankruptcy again, you're barred from email for life. Hmm, come to think of it, not a bad idea.
@MyMarrakesh Nice to meet you. We were in Marrakesh a few months ago actually, too briefly.
@MakahaT I couldn't disagree more: how we act internally defines what standing we have to act upon externally.
@sjcobrien I get that it's complicated. But leaked by upset employee is different than breaking and entering to steal company docs, I think.
@howardweaver True, I think you get a "significant public interest" exemption there. Rules meant to be broken, etc. But rules, still.
@cheeky_geeky That's just so we would know where to find him when he's indicted. Ok, that's inappropriate humor. Sorry about that.
@sjcobrien Fascinating. I'm learning. But you're creating a market for theft, no? Seems different than inside sources or encouraging leaks.
@nelcarter I think there's a difference. @karaswisher had a good piece on the subject today:  http://bit.ly/3WBeTi
@howardweaver Hmm. Wouldn't you distinguish a known insider source leaking, versus an outsider thief?
@davewiner E.g. News Corp accused of paying hackers to break into cell phones of high-profile people in UK, did you see that? Not ok.
@davewiner Surprised to hear you say this -- even though they were stolen, not leaked? What if the next guy pays a thief to steal?
And on role of media: instead of endlessly debating political calculus, should be clamoring to hold all gov officials to account.
My view: if we don't investigate and prosecute government law breaking, we have no standing for justice anywhere in the world.

@supersat we have had to charge sales tax to WA ever since being taken over by Amazon- nothing more than that though.

@robstak we're not providing the pee. Please note there is no pee in the "in the box" section. No pee.
@robstak hey, your pee needs to go somewhere, what better place to put it than a bag labeled "pee"?
@ciwanski1 yes, because we make sure to include our urine in each order, too.

Comments from important media voices on Info for Communities report: Commissioners and Chairman http://t.co/kEiaKqO
Info recommendation: Make it easier for citizens to monitor govt by putting more proceedings, documents and data online. #opengov
Info Needs: Govt is not the main player in this drama but it can remove obstacles confronting those trying to solve this problem.
RT @lalorek: Watching live feed of the @FCC from Wimberley, a small town in the Texas Hill Country. Love the Internet. http://www.fcc.go ...
Internet: Reduced costs of gathering, producing, distributing news; citizens choose their news and in some cases report it themselves
Information Needs of Communities report http://t.co/D1c7zXG
Better picture for radio. National news / talk format is booming. Though local news is shrinking.
Consequences: @baltimoresun produced 32% fewer stories in 2009 than in 1999. Throughout U.S. local beats lost reporters.
Findings: Most of media landscape is vibrant; serious issues: shortages of local reporting (holding civic institutions accountable)
First principle of report: First Amendment. Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press.
Info Needs of Communities: Launched at a time of rapid change and great transformation in the media world.

Thanks to all who watched Chairman's #openinternet remarks and participated online. The remarks are here: http://bit.ly/fsWmC7
To maximize investment incentives, broadband providers must have the flexibility to reasonably manage their networks. #openinternet
Right to level playing field: Proposed framework would bar unreasonable discrimination in transmitting lawful network traffic. #openinternet
Right to send & receive: Internet users can go where they want and say what they want online, via devices of choice. #openinternet
Right to know: Consumers & innovators have right to know broadband service info, like how networks are being managed. #openinternet
3 basic principles for consumers & innovators: right to know, right to send and receive, right to a level playing field. #openinternet
The InternetÕs openness and freedom have enabled itÕs unparalleled success. These qualities must be preserved and protected. #openinternet
Proposed framework is product of a long, bipartisan history, first articulated by Republican FCC Chairmen Powell and Martin. #openinternet
Chairman: ÒThese proposals are consistent with President ObamaÕs commitment to Ôkeep the Internet as it should be - open and free.ÕÓ
Chairman: The goals of the #openinternet rules - foster innovation and massive investment at edge and core of networks.

@canoeberry As I said in the column, one $30 purchase entitles you to install it on as many personal Macs as you own.
@RiveraLabs It's because I have FIOS at home. I also tried it on a slower connection and it too 90 minutes or so, as I reported.
@5speedstudio Au contra ire. I noted that Quicken fails, and said Adobe Flash works and that I had only 1 incompatible app.
@mcintee_cpa Of the tablets I've reviewed so far, I consider iPad still the front runner. Haven't tested Lenovo's.

@edbott Perhaps someone who had retired, no longer needed Pro, and had purchased a cheaper 32-bit PC. I really get emails asking about that.

@plasticbagUK I knew that I was buying music from AAPL with DRM. What I didn't know were the restrictions, *because that's how DRM works.*
@plasticbagUK  I *wasn't*entirely aware of limitations of iTunes music!  AAPL changed contract ex post facto, as w/iTunes streams.

@NathanBowers SEC's not catching Madoff was dumb, but he only lost $50B. Not catching systemic risk-SEC's *core job*- cost us ~$2T.
@btazzi I picked Merrill b/c of their misrepresentation of auction-rate security risk, but there's plenty of blame to go around.
@rickyricardo I doubt Madoff is an opening act. Total damage from fraud will pale in comparison to damage from CDOs and CDSs.
In particular, SEC's epic fail isn't that they let Madoff do what Madoff did, it's that they let Merrill do what Merrill did.
Madoff is a sideshow. Congress prefers focusing on a corrupt individual to a corrupt system, as the latter is much harder to fix.

@healthythinker Not sure CSM going to Web-only is a crisis - the crisis was the lousy biz model. Web-only looks like a *solution* for CSM

@matthewburton No question McC could have done more, but he was gracious when he knew it would cost him in the eyes of his own supporters

#2 whitespace explanation, from 2004: http://icanhaz.com/public_goods (All Twitter problems can be solved with another layer of indirection)
Wifi uses coord, not contract, to control interference. MANY more devices can use same spectrum. Whitespace allows longer range wifi.
@mvndrvt has asked me to explain the importance of whitespace in 140 chars. Two attempts follow

@chuq Ah, yes. I love that idea -- move all hets to civil union status, and let the religions sort out the rest. (Never happen, but gd idea)
@chuq that would require a fairly fundamental re-writing of the first amendment, no? the state can't require much of religion, by design
@gregelin Prop 8 middle ground is 1st Amdmt. Religions may define the unions they solemnize. Banning CIVIL gay marriage, otoh, is pure hate

@soniasimone Right, keeping up with Teresa is hard, but that's the point. TIME should be crediting pioneers, rather than ganking their work
@ourfounder Saw this in '95, when Phil Elmer-DeWitt ran bogus inet research on cover, and TIME never retracted. This time WE can retract it
(1/4) OK, Fuck Lev Grossman & TIME magazine, who presents solid old ideas as shiny new ones to his retrograde users.
(2/4) Teresa Nielsen-Hayden invented disemvoweling in 2002 for Making Light Lev sells it to TIME readers as hot new idea of 2008, UNCREDITED
(3/4) He won't fix the error, b/c its not TIME's policy to admit that they don't track tech trends closely enough to report them accurately
(4/4) Teresa N-H is a Living National Treasure for governance strategy; shame that Lev likes her idea but doesn't see any need to credit her

I'm sitting on the bus next to the guy who used E8 to come up with a theory of everything. Physics. Garrett Lisi.
Excellent, that *is* Robin Williams in the TED registration line.

Packing for TED. Any other Twitterers going to be there?
@loiclemeur don't be pissed... TED starts tomorrow night! Something to look forward to.
Lots of meetings today, no time to twitter. About to start last meeting of the day.

@kamranjune I'm a bit younger than Ben Franklin, you know. Also a bit more alive, these days.
@omigog sorry, that was debate commentary
Wow, well said.
I didn't like the Xerox line because it violated trademark. Or maybe they're a donor? I'm sure we can find a Xerox-Clinton donor. Silliness.
"Silly season." Nice positive spin on negative campaigning.
McCain/NYT flap misses the point. People should *read* the story. No gotcha there, no bad implications. Just maybe his blind spot to optics.

@DAChesterFrench Like I always say, "Live life well." :)
Incredible day of powder snow skiing at Squaw Valley USA. Now to hit the hot tub before the long ride home.
@seth http://twitpic.com/174s8 - Not fair that you are in my homeland without me :)
The new tapas place in Squaw Valley called 22 is fantastic. Say hello to Ray, the owner, he is a really good guy and was good to us.
@tom_kelly I know! It is raining here at Squaw Valley too. The top of the mountain is getting some snow but this is painful to watch.
The mountains and ski culture are food for my soul.
Made it to #tahoeskihaus for the weekend. Sadly, it is raining in Tahoe. Time for the hot tub and conversations on real estate in BC.
@saarsaar not sure how the snow is. anyone up in tahoe right now? what's it look like?
After an epic week at Facebook. Getting ready for an epic weekend at Squaw Valley :)
Why does every travel site plaster their entire site with ads making it impossible to read and/or find the actual content?

Our full summary of the WWDC keynote:
Apple Debuts Aggressively Priced iPhone 3GS, MacBooks http://tinyurl.com/o4tu6v (via @bxchen)
@juantxon thanks! appreciate your feedback!
And finally no Steve Jobs at #wwdc. Despite all the product announcements, his presence was missed.
@crainsmith it didn't seem like that so all cool!
Apple #wwdc keynote wraps up. Highlights: New pricing on MacBook Pros, new iPhone 3G S, iPhone 3G priced at $99
Price of iPhone 3G to drop to $99. Wow. That is incredible. #wwdc
iPhone 3G S is good but lacks the big 'wow' factor. Will cost $199 for 16GB and $299 for 32 GB #wwdc
Voice command comes to iPhone 3G S. Impressively easy to use interface. Shldn't be a surprise after the voice-controlled iPod Shuffle #wwdc
New iPhone 3G S can do 30 fps video with audio. Now that is cool! #wwdc
Disappointed about lack of fresh design in hardware. But iPhone 3G S will be 2x to 3x faster. New 3 megapixel autofocus camera #wwdc
New phone from Apple: iPhone 3G S where S stands for Speed. Same design as iPhone 3G but new inside #wwdc
@crainsmith Yes an app developer had a glitch during the demo.
iPhone OS 3.0 to be available worldwide June 17. Free for current iPhone users. $9.95 for iPod Touch users. #wwdc
First technical glitch in a demo at #wwdc.Has this ever happened before? Apple losing its touch?
iPhone pulling far ahead of rivals with features such as find my phone, incredible apps, turn by turn navigation accessories, e-books #wwdc
Demo segment at #wwdc is incredibly long and at times boring. Get on with the show Apple!
TomTom dock mounts on windshield, charges iPhone and enhances its GPS. Is this the begining of the end for standalone GPS devices? #wwdc
Turn-by-turn apps finally come to the iphone. TomTom at #wwdc says it will have an optional car accessory dock for the iPhone.
Find My iPhone feature also offers remote wipe so you can erase all data on it if phone is stolen or lost. Very cool Apple! #wwdc
If you misplace your phone you can log into MobileMe in any web browser and it will show where your iphone is on a map .#wwdc #findmyiphone
Apple introduces super awesome 'Find My iPhone' feature available to only Mobile Me users. #wwdc
MMS support for iPhone available from AT&T "later this summer". Apple gets the first boos of the day from the audience #wwdc
Apple mentioning iPhone OS 3.0 features first revealed in March : cut, copy, paste, undo support, MMS #wwdc
@Odbe34 Sorry, not sure. Apple didn't say anything specific about UK availability or pricing
Apple has sold 40 million iPhones and iPod Touches so far. 50,000 Apps available in the App store today. #wwdc
Snow Leopard is priced at $29 for current Leopard users. A family pack for several machines is $49. Available this Sept. #wwdc
Safari 4 to have full history search including Cover Flow view of browsing history. Safari 4  is fastest browser now,  says Apple #wwdc
@Odbe34 Gadget Lab is live blogging the keynote but no Apple live feed from the keynote.
Apple talking about updates to OS X Snow Leopard with 90% of the features in it refined. Maill will be faster. #wwdc
Apple is getting really aggressive on pricing. MacBook Air gets a price cut as well with base model now starting at $1499.  #wwdc
Apple says its latest laptops are the "world's greenest lineup of notebooks" #wwdc
FireWire 800 is back in a new, upgraded 13-inch MacBook Pro.. The notebook costs $1199. Pretty sweet pricing.
And the new 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1699. The 17-inch version is priced at $2499 #wwdc
New Macbook Pro has SD card slot  instead of the ExpressCard slot. That is cool and perfect for all those DSLR camera users! #wwdc
Apple showing brand new version of the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Unibody construction, two hours  longer battery life than before #wwdc

@ryan_thornburg As an exit strategy, it has to be digital complement print. My fear is news exex still don't see this as a 1-way migration.
@ryan_thornburg It's a great question, of course. But I hope your students realize it's a trick question :)
@ryan_thornburg Cost of the paper ecosystem is huge & unnecessary. For once, nupes should innovate & adapt rather than cling to fantasies.
@ryan_thornburg Buggy whip makers had good times too. Unless they adapted, they died. If you cut costs you can still cover what you should.
@ryan_thornburg Nupe prob is debt load & delivery cost, not so much cash flow. Rent a space, disperse reporters, wean stragglers off print.
@ryan_thornburg They should be in the biz of digital delivery cuz that's where their customers R. Web is a repository & part of a biz model.
